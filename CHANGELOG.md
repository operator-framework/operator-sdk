### Changed
- Upgrade minimal Ansible version in the init projects from `2.4` to `2.6`. ([#2107](https://github.com/operator-framework/operator-sdk/pull/2107))

### Deprecated

### Removed

### Bug Fixes

## v0.12.0

### Added

- Added `Operator Version: X.Y.Z` information in the operator logs.([#1953](https://github.com/operator-framework/operator-sdk/pull/1953))
- Make Ansible verbosity configurable via the `ansible-verbosity` flag. ([#2087](https://github.com/operator-framework/operator-sdk/pull/2087))
- Autogenerate CLI documentation via `make cli-doc` ([#2099](https://github.com/operator-framework/operator-sdk/pull/2099))

### Changed

- **Breaking change:** Changed required Go version from `1.12` to `1.13`. This change applies to the SDK project itself and Go projects scaffolded by the SDK. Projects that import this version of the SDK require Go 1.13 to compile. ([#1949](https://github.com/operator-framework/operator-sdk/pull/1949))

### Deprecated

- Upgrade Helm version from `v2.14.1` to `v2.15.0`. ([#2083](https://github.com/operator-framework/operator-sdk/pull/2083))
- Upgrade [`controller-runtime`](https://github.com/kubernetes-sigs/controller-runtime) version from `v0.2.0` to [`v0.3.0`](https://github.com/kubernetes-sigs/controller-runtime/releases/tag/v0.3.0). ([#2083](https://github.com/operator-framework/operator-sdk/pull/2083))
- Upgrade [`controller-tools`](https://github.com/kubernetes-sigs/controller-tools) version from `v0.2.1+git` to [`v0.2.2`](https://github.com/kubernetes-sigs/controller-tools/releases/tag/v0.2.2). ([#2083](https://github.com/operator-framework/operator-sdk/pull/2083))

### Removed

- Removed `--dep-manager` flag and support for `dep`-based projects. Projects will be scaffolded to use Go modules. ([#1949](https://github.com/operator-framework/operator-sdk/pull/1949))

### Bug Fixes

- OLM internal manager is not returning errors in the initialization. ([#1976](https://github.com/operator-framework/operator-sdk/pull/1976))
- Added missing default role permission for `deployments`, which is required to create the metrics service for the operator. ([#2090](https://github.com/operator-framework/operator-sdk/pull/2090))
- Handle invalid maxArtifacts annotation on CRs for Ansible based operators. ([2093](https://github.com/operator-framework/operator-sdk/pull/2093))
- When validating package manifests, only return an error if default channel is not set and more than one channel is available. ([#2116](https://github.com/operator-framework/operator-sdk/pull/2116))

## v0.11.0

### Added

- Added support for event filtering for ansible operator. ([#1968](https://github.com/operator-framework/operator-sdk/issues/1968))
- Added new `--skip-generation` flag to the `operator-sdk add api` command to support skipping generation of deepcopy and OpenAPI code and OpenAPI CRD specs. ([#1890](https://github.com/operator-framework/operator-sdk/pull/1890))
- The `operator-sdk olm-catalog gen-csv` command now produces indented JSON for the `alm-examples` annotation. ([#1793](https://github.com/operator-framework/operator-sdk/pull/1793))
- Added flag `--dep-manager` to command [`operator-sdk print-deps`](https://github.com/operator-framework/operator-sdk/blob/master/doc/sdk-cli-reference.md#print-deps) to specify the type of dependency manager file to print. The choice of dependency manager is inferred from top-level dependency manager files present if `--dep-manager` is not set. ([#1819](https://github.com/operator-framework/operator-sdk/pull/1819))
- Ansible based operators now gather and serve metrics about each custom resource on port 8686 of the metrics service. ([#1723](https://github.com/operator-framework/operator-sdk/pull/1723))
- Added the Go version, OS, and architecture to the output of `operator-sdk version` ([#1863](https://github.com/operator-framework/operator-sdk/pull/1863))
- Added support for `ppc64le-linux` for the `operator-sdk` binary and the Helm operator base image. ([#1533](https://github.com/operator-framework/operator-sdk/pull/1533))
- Added new `--version` flag to the `operator-sdk scorecard` command to support a new output format for the scorecard. ([#1916](https://github.com/operator-framework/operator-sdk/pull/1916)
- Added new `--selector` flag to the `operator-sdk scorecard` command to support filtering scorecard tests based on labels added to each test. ([#1916](https://github.com/operator-framework/operator-sdk/pull/1916)
- Added new `--list` flag to the `operator-sdk scorecard` command to support listing scorecard tests that would be executed based on selector filters. ([#1916](https://github.com/operator-framework/operator-sdk/pull/1916)
- For scorecard version v1alpha2 only, return code logic was added to return 1 if any of the selected scorecard tests fail.  A return code of 0 is returned if all selected tests pass. ([#1916](https://github.com/operator-framework/operator-sdk/pull/1916)

### Changed

- The Helm operator now uses the CR name for the release name for newly created CRs. Existing CRs will continue to use their existing UID-based release name. When a release name collision occurs (when CRs of different types share the same name), the second CR will fail to install with an error about a duplicate name. ([#1818](https://github.com/operator-framework/operator-sdk/pull/1818))
- Commands [`olm uninstall`](https://github.com/operator-framework/operator-sdk/blob/master/doc/sdk-cli-reference.md#uninstall) and [`olm status`](https://github.com/operator-framework/operator-sdk/blob/master/doc/sdk-cli-reference.md#status) no longer use a `--version` flag to specify OLM version. This information is now retrieved from the running cluster. ([#1634](https://github.com/operator-framework/operator-sdk/pull/1634))
- The Helm operator no longer prints manifest diffs in the operator log at verbosity levels lower than INFO ([#1857](https://github.com/operator-framework/operator-sdk/pull/1857))
- CRD manifest `spec.version` is still supported, but users will see a warning message if `spec.versions` is not present and an error if `spec.versions` is populated but the version in `spec.version` is not in `spec.versions`. ([#1876](https://github.com/operator-framework/operator-sdk/pull/1876))
- Upgrade base image for Go, Helm, and scorecard proxy from `registry.access.redhat.com/ubi7/ubi-minimal:latest` to `registry.access.redhat.com/ubi8/ubi-minimal:latest`. ([#1952](https://github.com/operator-framework/operator-sdk/pull/1952))
- Upgrade base image for Ansible from `registry.access.redhat.com/ubi7/ubi:latest` to `registry.access.redhat.com/ubi8/ubi:latest`. ([#1990](https://github.com/operator-framework/operator-sdk/pull/1990) and [#2004](https://github.com/operator-framework/operator-sdk/pull/2004))
- Updated kube-state-metrics dependency from `v1.6.0` to `v1.7.2`. ([#1943](https://github.com/operator-framework/operator-sdk/pull/1943))

### Breaking changes

- Upgrade Kubernetes version from `kubernetes-1.13.4` to `kubernetes-1.14.1` ([#1876](https://github.com/operator-framework/operator-sdk/pull/1876))
- Upgrade `github.com/operator-framework/operator-lifecycle-manager` version from `b8a4faf68e36feb6d99a6aec623b405e587b17b1` to `0.10.1` ([#1876](https://github.com/operator-framework/operator-sdk/pull/1876))
- Upgrade [`controller-runtime`](https://github.com/kubernetes-sigs/controller-runtime) version from `v0.1.12` to `v0.2.0` ([#1876](https://github.com/operator-framework/operator-sdk/pull/1876))
  - The package `sigs.k8s.io/controller-runtime/pkg/runtime/scheme` is deprecated, and contains no code. Replace this import with `sigs.k8s.io/controller-runtime/pkg/scheme` where relevant.
  - The package `sigs.k8s.io/controller-runtime/pkg/runtime/log` is deprecated. Replace this import with `sigs.k8s.io/controller-runtime/pkg/log` where relevant.
  - The package `sigs.k8s.io/controller-runtime/pkg/runtime/signals` is deprecated. Replace this import with `sigs.k8s.io/controller-runtime/pkg/manager/signals` where relevant.
  - All methods on [`sigs.k8s.io/controller-runtime/pkg/client.Client`](https://github.com/kubernetes-sigs/controller-runtime/blob/v0.2.0/pkg/client/interfaces.go#L104) (except for `Get()`) have been updated. Instead of each using a `struct`-typed or variadic functional option parameter, or having no option parameter, each now uses a variadic interface option parameter typed for each method. See `List()` below for an example.
  - [`sigs.k8s.io/controller-runtime/pkg/client.Client`](https://github.com/kubernetes-sigs/controller-runtime/blob/v0.2.0/pkg/client/interfaces.go#L104)'s `List()` method signature has been updated: `List(ctx context.Context, opts *client.ListOptions, list runtime.Object) error` is now [`List(ctx context.Context, list runtime.Object, opts ...client.ListOption) error`](https://github.com/kubernetes-sigs/controller-runtime/blob/v0.2.0/pkg/client/interfaces.go#L61). To migrate:
      ```go
      import (
        "context"

        "sigs.k8s.io/controller-runtime/pkg/client"
      )

      ...

      // Old
      listOpts := &client.ListOptions{}
      listOpts.InNamespace("namespace")
      err = r.client.List(context.TODO(), listOps, podList)
      // New
      listOpts := []client.ListOption{
        client.InNamespace("namespace"),
      }
      err = r.client.List(context.TODO(), podList, listOpts...)
      ```
- [`pkg/test.FrameworkClient`](https://github.com/operator-framework/operator-sdk/blob/master/pkg/test/client.go#L33) methods `List()` and `Delete()` have new signatures corresponding to the homonymous methods of `sigs.k8s.io/controller-runtime/pkg/client.Client`. ([#1876](https://github.com/operator-framework/operator-sdk/pull/1876))
- CRD file names were previously of the form `<group>_<version>_<kind>_crd.yaml`. Now that CRD manifest `spec.version` is deprecated in favor of `spec.versions`, i.e. multiple versions can be specified in one CRD, CRD file names have the form `<full group>_<resource>_crd.yaml`. `<full group>` is the full group name of your CRD while `<group>` is the last subdomain of `<full group>`, ex. `foo.bar.com` vs `foo`. `<resource>` is the plural lower-case CRD Kind found at `spec.names.plural`. ([#1876](https://github.com/operator-framework/operator-sdk/pull/1876))
- Upgrade Python version from `2.7` to `3.6`, Ansible version from `2.8.0` to `~=2.8` and ansible-runner from `1.2` to `1.3.4` in the Ansible based images. ([#1947](https://github.com/operator-framework/operator-sdk/pull/1947))
- Made the default scorecard version `v1alpha2` which is new for this release and could break users that were parsing the older scorecard output (`v1alpha1`).  Users can still specify version `v1alpha1` on the scorecard configuration to use the older style for some period of time until `v1alpha1` is removed.
- Replaced `pkg/kube-metrics.NewCollectors()` with `pkg/kube-metrics.NewMetricsStores()` and changed exported function signature for `pkg/kube-metrics.ServeMetrics()` due to a [breaking change in kube-state-metrics](https://github.com/kubernetes/kube-state-metrics/pull/786). ([#1943](https://github.com/operator-framework/operator-sdk/pull/1943))

### Deprecated

### Removed

- Removed flag `--as-file` from command [`operator-sdk print-deps`](https://github.com/operator-framework/operator-sdk/blob/master/doc/sdk-cli-reference.md#print-deps), which now only prints packages and versions in dependency manager file format. The choice of dependency manager type is set by `--dep-manager` or inferred from top-level dependency manager files present if `--dep-manager` is not set. ([#1819](https://github.com/operator-framework/operator-sdk/pull/1819))

### Bug Fixes

- Configure the repo path correctly in `operator-sdk add crd` and prevent the command from running outside of an operator project. ([#1660](https://github.com/operator-framework/operator-sdk/pull/1660))
- In the Helm operator, skip owner reference injection for cluster-scoped resources in release manifests. The Helm operator only supports namespace-scoped CRs, and namespaced resources cannot own cluster-scoped resources. ([#1817](https://github.com/operator-framework/operator-sdk/pull/1817))
- Package manifests generated with [`gen-csv`](https://github.com/operator-framework/operator-sdk/blob/master/doc/sdk-cli-reference.md#gen-csv) respect the `--operator-name` flag, channel names are checked for duplicates before (re-)generation. ([#1693](https://github.com/operator-framework/operator-sdk/pull/1693))
- Generated inventory for Ansible-based Operators now sets the localhost's `ansible_python_interpreter` to `{{ ansible_playbook_python }}`, to properly match the [implicit localhost](https://docs.ansible.com/ansible/latest/inventory/implicit_localhost.html). ([#1952](https://github.com/operator-framework/operator-sdk/pull/1952))
- Fixed an issue in `operator-sdk olm-catalog gen-csv` where the generated CSV is missing the expected set of owned CRDs. ([#2017](https://github.com/operator-framework/operator-sdk/pull/2017))
- The command `operator-sdk olm-catalog gen-csv --csv-version=<version> --update-crds` would fail to copy over CRD manifests into `deploy/olm-catalog` for manifests whose name didn't end with a `_crd.yaml` suffix. This has been fixed so `gen-csv` now copies all CRD manifests specified by `deploy/olm-catalog/csv_config.yaml` by checking the type of the manifest rather than the filename suffix. ([#2015](https://github.com/operator-framework/operator-sdk/pull/2015))
- Added missing `jmespath` dependency to Ansible-based Operator .travis.yml file template. ([#2027](https://github.com/operator-framework/operator-sdk/pull/2027))
- Fixed invalid usage of `logr.Logger.Info()` in the Ansible-based operator implementation, which caused unnecessary operator panics. ([#2031](https://github.com/operator-framework/operator-sdk/pull/2031))

## v0.10.0

### Added

- Document new compile-time dependency `mercurial` in user-facing documentation. ([#1683](https://github.com/operator-framework/operator-sdk/pull/1683))
- Adds new flag `--zap-time-encoding` to the flagset provided by `pkg/log/zap`. This flag configures the timestamp format produced by the zap logger. See the [logging doc](https://github.com/operator-framework/operator-sdk/blob/master/doc/user/logging.md) for more information. ([#1529](https://github.com/operator-framework/operator-sdk/pull/1529))

### Changed

- **Breaking Change:** New configuration format for the `operator-sdk scorecard` using config files. See [`doc/test-framework/scorecard`](doc/test-framework/scorecard.md) for more info ([#1641](https://github.com/operator-framework/operator-sdk/pull/1641))
- **Breaking change:** CSV config field `role-path` is now `role-paths` and takes a list of strings. Users can now specify multiple `Role` and `ClusterRole` manifests using `role-paths`. ([#1704](https://github.com/operator-framework/operator-sdk/pull/1704))
- Make `ready` package idempotent. Now, a user can call `Set()` or `Unset()` to set the operator's readiness without knowing the current state. ([#1761](https://github.com/operator-framework/operator-sdk/pull/1761))

### Bug Fixes

- Check if `metadata.annotations['alm-examples']` is non-empty before creating contained CR manifests in the scorecard. ([#1789](https://github.com/operator-framework/operator-sdk/pull/1789))

## v0.9.0

### Added

- Adds support for building OCI images with [podman](https://podman.io/), e.g. `operator-sdk build --image-builder=podman`. ([#1488](https://github.com/operator-framework/operator-sdk/pull/1488))
- New option for [`operator-sdk up local --enable-delve`](https://github.com/operator-framework/operator-sdk/blob/master/doc/sdk-cli-reference.md#up), which can be used to start the operator in remote debug mode with the [delve](https://github.com/go-delve/delve) debugger listening on port 2345. ([#1422](https://github.com/operator-framework/operator-sdk/pull/1422))
- Enables controller-runtime metrics in Helm operator projects. ([#1482](https://github.com/operator-framework/operator-sdk/pull/1482))
- New flags `--vendor` and `--skip-validation` for [`operator-sdk new`](https://github.com/operator-framework/operator-sdk/blob/master/doc/sdk-cli-reference.md#new) that direct the SDK to initialize a new project with a `vendor/` directory, and without validating project dependencies. `vendor/` is not written by default. ([#1519](https://github.com/operator-framework/operator-sdk/pull/1519))
- Generating and serving info metrics about each custom resource. By default these metrics are exposed on port 8686. ([#1277](https://github.com/operator-framework/operator-sdk/pull/1277))
- Scaffold a `pkg/apis/<group>/group.go` package file to avoid `go/build` errors when running Kubernetes code generators. ([#1401](https://github.com/operator-framework/operator-sdk/pull/1401))
- Adds a new extra variable containing the unmodified CR spec for ansible based operators. [#1563](https://github.com/operator-framework/operator-sdk/pull/1563)
- New flag `--repo` for subcommands [`new`](https://github.com/operator-framework/operator-sdk/blob/master/doc/sdk-cli-reference.md#new) and [`migrate`](https://github.com/operator-framework/operator-sdk/blob/master/doc/sdk-cli-reference.md#migrate) specifies the repository path to be used in Go source files generated by the SDK. This flag can only be used with [Go modules](https://github.com/golang/go/wiki/Modules). ([#1475](https://github.com/operator-framework/operator-sdk/pull/1475))
- Adds `--go-build-args` flag to `operator-sdk build` for providing additional Go build arguments. ([#1582](https://github.com/operator-framework/operator-sdk/pull/1582))
- New flags `--csv-channel` and `--default-channel` for subcommand [`gen-csv`](https://github.com/operator-framework/operator-sdk/blob/master/doc/sdk-cli-reference.md#gen-csv) that add channels to and update the [package manifest](https://github.com/operator-framework/operator-registry/#manifest-format) in `deploy/olm-catalog/<operator-name>` when generating a new CSV or updating an existing one. ([#1364](https://github.com/operator-framework/operator-sdk/pull/1364))
- Adds `go.mod` and `go.sum` to switch from `dep` to [Go modules](https://github.com/golang/go/wiki/Modules) to manage dependencies for the SDK project itself. ([#1566](https://github.com/operator-framework/operator-sdk/pull/1566))
- New flag `--operator-name` for [`operator-sdk olm-catalog gen-csv`](https://github.com/operator-framework/operator-sdk/blob/master/doc/sdk-cli-reference.md#gen-csv) to specify the operator name, ex. `memcached-operator`, to use in CSV generation. The project's name is used (old behavior) if `--operator-name` is not set. ([#1571](https://github.com/operator-framework/operator-sdk/pull/1571))
- New flag `--local-operator-flags` for `operator-sdk test local --up-local` to specify flags to run a local operator with during a test. ([#1509](https://github.com/operator-framework/operator-sdk/pull/1509))

### Changed

- Upgrade the version of the dependency [controller-runtime](https://github.com/kubernetes-sigs/controller-runtime) from `v0.1.10` to `v0.1.12`. ([#1612](https://github.com/operator-framework/operator-sdk/pull/1612))
- Remove TypeMeta declaration from the implementation of the objects ([#1462](https://github.com/operator-framework/operator-sdk/pull/1462/))
- Relaxed API version format check when parsing `pkg/apis` in code generators. API dir structures can now be of the format `pkg/apis/<group>/<anything>`, where `<anything>` was previously required to be in the Kubernetes version format, ex. `v1alpha1`. ([#1525](https://github.com/operator-framework/operator-sdk/pull/1525))
- The SDK and operator projects will work outside of `$GOPATH/src` when using [Go modules](https://github.com/golang/go/wiki/Modules). ([#1475](https://github.com/operator-framework/operator-sdk/pull/1475))
-  `CreateMetricsService()` function from the metrics package accepts a REST config (\*rest.Config) and an array of ServicePort objects ([]v1.ServicePort) as input to create Service metrics. `CRPortName` constant is added to describe the string of custom resource port name. ([#1560](https://github.com/operator-framework/operator-sdk/pull/1560) and [#1626](https://github.com/operator-framework/operator-sdk/pull/1626))
- Changed the flag `--skip-git-init` to [`--git-init`](https://github.com/operator-framework/operator-sdk/blob/master/doc/sdk-cli-reference.md#new). This changes the default behavior of `operator-sdk new` to not initialize the new project directory as a git repository with `git init`. This behavior is now opt-in with `--git-init`. ([#1588](https://github.com/operator-framework/operator-sdk/pull/1588))
- `operator-sdk new` will no longer create the initial commit for a new project, even with `--git-init=true`. ([#1588](https://github.com/operator-framework/operator-sdk/pull/1588))
- When errors occur setting up the Kubernetes client for RBAC role generation, `operator-sdk new --type=helm` now falls back to a default RBAC role instead of failing. ([#1627](https://github.com/operator-framework/operator-sdk/pull/1627))

### Removed

- The SDK no longer depends on a `vendor/` directory to manage dependencies *only if* using [Go modules](https://github.com/golang/go/wiki/Modules). The SDK and operator projects will only use vendoring if using `dep`, or modules and a `vendor/` dir is present. ([#1519](https://github.com/operator-framework/operator-sdk/pull/1519))
- **Breaking change:** `ExposeMetricsPort` is removed and replaced with `CreateMetricsService()` function. `PrometheusPortName` constant is replaced with `OperatorPortName`. ([#1560](https://github.com/operator-framework/operator-sdk/pull/1560))
- Removes `Gopkg.toml` and `Gopkg.lock` to drop the use of `dep` in favor of [Go modules](https://github.com/golang/go/wiki/Modules) to manage dependencies for the SDK project itself. ([#1566](https://github.com/operator-framework/operator-sdk/pull/1566))

## v0.8.2

### Bug Fixes

- Fixes header file content validation when the content contains empty lines or centered text. ([#1544](https://github.com/operator-framework/operator-sdk/pull/1544))
- Generated CSV's that include a deployment install strategy will be checked for a reference to `metadata.annotations['olm.targetNamespaces']`, and if one is not found a reference will be added to the `WATCH_NAMESPACE` env var for all containers in the deployment. This is a bug because any other value that references the CSV's namespace is incorrect. ([#1396](https://github.com/operator-framework/operator-sdk/pull/1396))
- Build `-trimpath` was not being respected. `$GOPATH` was not expanding because `exec.Cmd{}` is not executed in a shell environment. ([#1535](https://github.com/operator-framework/operator-sdk/pull/1535))
- Running the [scorecard](https://github.com/operator-framework/operator-sdk/blob/master/doc/sdk-cli-reference.md#up) with `--olm-deployed` will now only use the first CR set in either the `cr-manifest` config option or the CSV's `metadata.annotations['alm-examples']` as was intended, and access manifests correctly from the config. ([#1565](https://github.com/operator-framework/operator-sdk/pull/1565))
- Use the correct domain names when generating CRD's instead that of the first CRD to be parsed. ([#1636](https://github.com/operator-framework/operator-sdk/pull/1636))

## v0.8.1

### Bug Fixes

- Fixes a regression that causes Helm RBAC generation to contain an empty custom ruleset when the chart's default manifest contains only namespaced resources. ([#1456](https://github.com/operator-framework/operator-sdk/pull/1456))
- Fixes an issue that causes Helm RBAC generation to fail when creating new operators with a Kubernetes context configured to connect to an OpenShift cluster. ([#1461](https://github.com/operator-framework/operator-sdk/pull/1461))

## v0.8.0

### Added

- New option for [`operator-sdk build --image-builder`](https://github.com/operator-framework/operator-sdk/blob/master/doc/sdk-cli-reference.md#build), which can be used to specify which image builder to use. Adds support for [buildah](https://github.com/containers/buildah/). ([#1311](https://github.com/operator-framework/operator-sdk/pull/1311))
- Manager is now configured with a new `DynamicRESTMapper`, which accounts for the fact that the default `RESTMapper`, which only checks resource types at startup, can't handle the case of first creating a CRD and then an instance of that CRD. ([#1329](https://github.com/operator-framework/operator-sdk/pull/1329))
- Unify CLI debug logging under a global `--verbose` flag ([#1361](https://github.com/operator-framework/operator-sdk/pull/1361))
- [Go module](https://github.com/golang/go/wiki/Modules) support by default for new Go operators and during Ansible and Helm operator migration. The dependency manager used for a new operator can be explicitly specified for new operators through the `--dep-manager` flag, available in [`operator-sdk new`](https://github.com/operator-framework/operator-sdk/blob/master/doc/sdk-cli-reference.md#new) and [`operator-sdk migrate`](https://github.com/operator-framework/operator-sdk/blob/master/doc/sdk-cli-reference.md#migrate). `dep` is still available through `--dep-manager=dep`. ([#1001](https://github.com/operator-framework/operator-sdk/pull/1001))
- New optional flag `--custom-api-import` for [`operator-sdk add controller`](https://github.com/operator-framework/operator-sdk/blob/master/doc/sdk-cli-reference.md#controller) to specify that the new controller reconciles a built-in or external Kubernetes API, and what import path and identifier it should have. ([#1344](https://github.com/operator-framework/operator-sdk/pull/1344))
- Operator Scorecard plugin support ([#1379](https://github.com/operator-framework/operator-sdk/pull/1379)). Documentation for scorecard plugins can be found in the main scorecard doc: [doc/test-framework/scorecard.md](./doc/test-framework/scorecard.md)

### Changed

- When Helm operator projects are created, the SDK now generates RBAC rules in `deploy/role.yaml` based on the chart's default manifest. ([#1188](https://github.com/operator-framework/operator-sdk/pull/1188))
- When debug level is 3 or higher, we will set the klog verbosity to that level. ([#1322](https://github.com/operator-framework/operator-sdk/pull/1322))
- Relaxed requirements for groups in new project API's. Groups passed to [`operator-sdk add api`](https://github.com/operator-framework/operator-sdk/blob/master/doc/sdk-cli-reference.md#api)'s `--api-version` flag can now have no subdomains, ex `core/v1`. See ([#1191](https://github.com/operator-framework/operator-sdk/issues/1191)) for discussion. ([#1313](https://github.com/operator-framework/operator-sdk/pull/1313))
- Renamed `--docker-build-args` option to `--image-build-args` option for `build` subcommand, because this option can now be shared with other image build tools than docker when `--image-builder` option is specified. ([#1311](https://github.com/operator-framework/operator-sdk/pull/1311))
- Reduces Helm release information in CR status to only the release name and manifest and moves it from `status.conditions` to a new top-level `deployedRelease` field. ([#1309](https://github.com/operator-framework/operator-sdk/pull/1309))
  - **WARNING**: Users with active CRs and releases who are upgrading their helm-based operator should upgrade to one based on v0.7.0 before upgrading further. Helm operators based on v0.8.0+ will not seamlessly transition release state to the persistent backend, and will instead uninstall and reinstall all managed releases.
- Go operator CRDs are overwritten when being regenerated by [`operator-sdk generate openapi`](https://github.com/operator-framework/operator-sdk/blob/master/doc/sdk-cli-reference.md#openapi). Users can now rely on `+kubebuilder` annotations in their API code, which provide access to most OpenAPIv3 [validation properties](https://github.com/OAI/OpenAPI-Specification/blob/master/versions/3.0.0.md#schema-object) (the full set will be supported in the near future, see [this PR](https://github.com/kubernetes-sigs/controller-tools/pull/190)) and [other CRD fields](https://book-v1.book.kubebuilder.io/beyond_basics/generating_crd.html). ([#1278](https://github.com/operator-framework/operator-sdk/pull/1278))
- Use `registry.access.redhat.com/ubi7/ubi-minimal:latest` base image for the Go and Helm operators and scorecard proxy ([#1376](https://github.com/operator-framework/operator-sdk/pull/1376))
- Allow "Owned CRDs Have Resources Listed" scorecard test to pass if the resources section exists

### Removed

- The SDK will no longer run `defaulter-gen` on running `operator-sdk generate k8s`. Defaulting for CRDs should be handled with mutating admission webhooks. ([#1288](https://github.com/operator-framework/operator-sdk/pull/1288))
- The `--version` flag was removed. Users should use the `operator-sdk version` command. ([#1444](https://github.com/operator-framework/operator-sdk/pull/1444))
- **Breaking Change**: The `test cluster` subcommand and the corresponding `--enable-tests` flag for the `build` subcommand have been removed ([#1414](https://github.com/operator-framework/operator-sdk/pull/1414))
- **Breaking Change**: The `--cluster-scoped` flag for `operator-sdk new` has been removed so it won't scaffold a cluster-scoped operator. Read the [operator scope](https://github.com/operator-framework/operator-sdk/blob/master/doc/operator-scope.md) documentation on the changes needed to run a cluster-scoped operator. ([#1434](https://github.com/operator-framework/operator-sdk/pull/1434))

### Bug Fixes

- [`operator-sdk generate openapi`](https://github.com/operator-framework/operator-sdk/blob/master/doc/sdk-cli-reference.md#openapi) no longer overwrites CRD values derived from `+kubebuilder` annotations in Go API code. See issues ([#1212](https://github.com/operator-framework/operator-sdk/issues/1212)) and ([#1323](https://github.com/operator-framework/operator-sdk/issues/1323)) for discussion. ([#1278](https://github.com/operator-framework/operator-sdk/pull/1278))
- Running [`operator-sdk gen-csv`](https://github.com/operator-framework/operator-sdk/blob/master/doc/sdk-cli-reference.md#gen-csv) on operators that do not have a CRDs directory, ex. `deploy/crds`, or do not have any [owned CRDs](https://github.com/operator-framework/operator-lifecycle-manager/blob/master/doc/design/building-your-csv.md#your-custom-resource-definitions), will not generate a "deploy/crds not found" error.

## v0.7.1

### Bug Fixes

- Pin dependency versions in Ansible build and test framework Dockerfiles to fix broken build and test framework images. ([#1348](https://github.com/operator-framework/operator-sdk/pull/1348))
- In Helm-based operators, when a custom resource with a failing release is reverted back to a working state, the `ReleaseFailed` condition is now correctly removed. ([#1321](https://github.com/operator-framework/operator-sdk/pull/1321))

## v0.7.0

### Added

- New optional flag `--header-file` for commands [`operator-sdk generate k8s`](https://github.com/operator-framework/operator-sdk/blob/master/doc/sdk-cli-reference.md#k8s) and [`operator-sdk add api`](https://github.com/operator-framework/operator-sdk/blob/master/doc/sdk-cli-reference.md#api) to supply a boilerplate header file for generated code. ([#1239](https://github.com/operator-framework/operator-sdk/pull/1239))
- JSON output support for `operator-sdk scorecard` subcommand ([#1228](https://github.com/operator-framework/operator-sdk/pull/1228))

### Changed

- Updated the helm-operator to store release state in kubernetes secrets in the same namespace of the custom resource that defines the release. ([#1102](https://github.com/operator-framework/operator-sdk/pull/1102))
  - **WARNING**: Users with active CRs and releases who are upgrading their helm-based operator should not skip this version. Future versions will not seamlessly transition release state to the persistent backend, and will instead uninstall and reinstall all managed releases.
- Change `namespace-manifest` flag in scorecard subcommand to `namespaced-manifest` to match other subcommands
- Subcommands of [`operator-sdk generate`](https://github.com/operator-framework/operator-sdk/blob/master/doc/sdk-cli-reference.md#generate) are now verbose by default. ([#1271](https://github.com/operator-framework/operator-sdk/pull/1271))
- [`operator-sdk olm-catalog gen-csv`](https://github.com/operator-framework/operator-sdk/blob/master/doc/sdk-cli-reference.md#gen-csv) parses Custom Resource manifests from `deploy/crds` or a custom path specified in `csv-config.yaml`, encodes them in a JSON array, and sets the CSV's [`metadata.annotations.alm-examples`](https://github.com/operator-framework/operator-lifecycle-manager/blob/master/doc/design/building-your-csv.md#crd-templates) field to that JSON. ([#1116](https://github.com/operator-framework/operator-sdk/pull/1116))

### Bug Fixes

- Fixed an issue that caused `operator-sdk new --type=helm` to fail for charts that have template files in nested template directories. ([#1235](https://github.com/operator-framework/operator-sdk/pull/1235))
- Fix bug in the YAML scanner used by `operator-sdk test` and `operator-sdk scorecard` that could result in a panic if a manifest file started with `---` ([#1258](https://github.com/operator-framework/operator-sdk/pull/1258))

## v0.6.0

### Added

- New flags for [`operator-sdk new --type=helm`](https://github.com/operator-framework/operator-sdk/blob/master/doc/sdk-cli-reference.md#new), which can be used to populate the project with an existing chart. ([#949](https://github.com/operator-framework/operator-sdk/pull/949))
- Command [`operator-sdk olm-catalog`](https://github.com/operator-framework/operator-sdk/blob/master/doc/sdk-cli-reference.md#olm-catalog) flag `--update-crds` optionally copies CRD's from `deploy/crds` when creating a new CSV or updating an existing CSV, and `--from-version` uses another versioned CSV manifest as a base for a new CSV version. ([#1016](https://github.com/operator-framework/operator-sdk/pull/1016))
- New flag `--olm-deployed` to direct the [`scorecard`](https://github.com/operator-framework/operator-sdk/blob/master/doc/sdk-cli-reference.md#scorecard) command to only use the CSV at `--csv-path` for manifest data, except for those provided to `--cr-manifest`. ([#1044](https://github.com/operator-framework/operator-sdk/pull/1044))
- Command [`version`](https://github.com/operator-framework/operator-sdk/pull/1171) prints the version of operator-sdk. ([#1171](https://github.com/operator-framework/operator-sdk/pull/1171))

### Changed

- Changed the Go, Helm, and Scorecard base images to `registry.access.redhat.com/ubi7-dev-preview/ubi-minimal:7.6` ([#1142](https://github.com/operator-framework/operator-sdk/pull/1142))
- CSV manifest are now versioned according to the `operator-registry` [manifest format](https://github.com/operator-framework/operator-registry#manifest-format). See issue [#900](https://github.com/operator-framework/operator-sdk/issues/900) for more details. ([#1016](https://github.com/operator-framework/operator-sdk/pull/1016))
- Unexported `CleanupNoT` function from `pkg/test`, as it is only intended to be used internally ([#1167](https://github.com/operator-framework/operator-sdk/pull/1167))

### Bug Fixes

- Fix issue where running `operator-sdk test local --up-local` would sometimes leave a running process in the background after exit ([#1089](https://github.com/operator-framework/operator-sdk/pull/1020))

## v0.5.0

### Added

- Updated the Kubernetes dependencies to `1.13.1` ([#1020](https://github.com/operator-framework/operator-sdk/pull/1020))
- Updated the controller-runtime version to `v0.1.10`. See the [controller-runtime `v0.1.10` release notes](https://github.com/kubernetes-sigs/controller-runtime/releases/tag/v0.1.10) for new features and bug fixes. ([#1020](https://github.com/operator-framework/operator-sdk/pull/1020))
- By default the controller-runtime metrics are exposed on port 8383. This is done as part of the scaffold in the main.go file, the port can be adjusted by modifying the `metricsPort` variable. [#786](https://github.com/operator-framework/operator-sdk/pull/786)
- A new command [`operator-sdk olm-catalog`](https://github.com/operator-framework/operator-sdk/blob/master/doc/sdk-cli-reference.md#olm-catalog) to be used as a parent for SDK subcommands generating code related to Operator Lifecycle Manager (OLM) Catalog integration, and subcommand [`operator-sdk olm-catalog gen-csv`](https://github.com/operator-framework/operator-sdk/blob/master/doc/sdk-cli-reference.md#gen-csv) which generates a Cluster Service Version for an operator so the OLM can deploy the operator in a cluster. ([#673](https://github.com/operator-framework/operator-sdk/pull/673))
- Helm-based operators have leader election turned on by default. When upgrading, add environment variable `POD_NAME` to your operator's Deployment using the Kubernetes downward API. To see an example, run `operator-sdk new --type=helm ...` and see file `deploy/operator.yaml`. [#1000](https://github.com/operator-framework/operator-sdk/pull/1000)
- A new command [`operator-sdk generate openapi`](https://github.com/operator-framework/operator-sdk/blob/master/doc/sdk-cli-reference.md#openapi) which generates OpenAPIv3 validation specs in Go and in CRD manifests as YAML. ([#869](https://github.com/operator-framework/operator-sdk/pull/869))
- The `operator-sdk add api` command now generates OpenAPIv3 validation specs in Go for that API, and in all CRD manifests as YAML.

### Changed

- In new Helm operator projects, the scaffolded CR `spec` field now contains the default values.yaml from the generated chart. ([#967](https://github.com/operator-framework/operator-sdk/pull/967))

### Deprecated

### Removed

### Bug Fixes

## v0.4.1

### Bug Fixes

- Make `up local` subcommand respect `KUBECONFIG` env var ([#996](https://github.com/operator-framework/operator-sdk/pull/996))
- Make `up local` subcommand use default namespace set in kubeconfig instead of hardcoded `default` and also add ability to watch all namespaces for ansible and helm type operators ([#996](https://github.com/operator-framework/operator-sdk/pull/996))
- Added k8s_status modules back to generation ([#972](https://github.com/operator-framework/operator-sdk/pull/972))
- Update checks for gvk registration to cover all cases for ansible ([#973](https://github.com/operator-framework/operator-sdk/pull/973) & [#1019](https://github.com/operator-framework/operator-sdk/pull/1019))
- Update reconciler for ansible and helm to use the cache rather than the API client. ([#1022](https://github.com/operator-framework/operator-sdk/pull/1022) & [#1048](https://github.com/operator-framework/operator-sdk/pull/1048) & [#1054](https://github.com/operator-framework/operator-sdk/pull/1054))
- Update reconciler to will update the status everytime for ansible ([#1066](https://github.com/operator-framework/operator-sdk/pull/1066))
- Update ansible proxy to recover dependent watches when pod is killed ([#1067](https://github.com/operator-framework/operator-sdk/pull/1067))
- Update ansible proxy to handle watching cluster scoped dependent watches ([#1031](https://github.com/operator-framework/operator-sdk/pull/1031))

## v0.4.0

### Added

- A new command [`operator-sdk migrate`](https://github.com/operator-framework/operator-sdk/blob/master/doc/sdk-cli-reference.md#migrate) which adds a main.go source file and any associated source files for an operator that is not of the "go" type. ([#887](https://github.com/operator-framework/operator-sdk/pull/887) and [#897](https://github.com/operator-framework/operator-sdk/pull/897))
- New commands [`operator-sdk run ansible`](https://github.com/operator-framework/operator-sdk/blob/master/doc/sdk-cli-reference.md#ansible) and [`operator-sdk run helm`](https://github.com/operator-framework/operator-sdk/blob/master/doc/sdk-cli-reference.md#helm) which run the SDK as ansible  and helm operator processes, respectively. These are intended to be used when running in a Pod inside a cluster. Developers wanting to run their operator locally should continue to use `up local`. ([#887](https://github.com/operator-framework/operator-sdk/pull/887) and [#897](https://github.com/operator-framework/operator-sdk/pull/897))
- Ansible operator proxy added the cache handler which allows the get requests to use the operators cache. [#760](https://github.com/operator-framework/operator-sdk/pull/760)
- Ansible operator proxy added ability to dynamically watch dependent resource that were created by ansible operator. [#857](https://github.com/operator-framework/operator-sdk/pull/857)
- Ansible-based operators have leader election turned on by default. When upgrading, add environment variable `POD_NAME` to your operator's Deployment using the Kubernetes downward API. To see an example, run `operator-sdk new --type=ansible ...` and see file `deploy/operator.yaml`.
- A new command [`operator-sdk scorecard`](https://github.com/operator-framework/operator-sdk/blob/master/doc/sdk-cli-reference.md#scorecard) which runs a series of generic tests on operators to ensure that an operator follows best practices. For more information, see the [`Scorecard Documentation`](doc/test-framework/scorecard.md)

### Changed

- The official images for the Ansible and Helm operators have moved! Travis now builds, tags, and pushes operator base images during CI ([#832](https://github.com/operator-framework/operator-sdk/pull/832)).
  - [quay.io/operator-framework/ansible-operator](https://quay.io/repository/operator-framework/ansible-operator)
  - [quay.io/operator-framework/helm-operator](https://quay.io/repository/operator-framework/helm-operator)

### Bug Fixes

- Fixes deadlocks during operator deployment rollouts, which were caused by operator pods requiring a leader election lock to become ready ([#932](https://github.com/operator-framework/operator-sdk/pull/932))

## v0.3.0

### Added

- Helm type operator generation support ([#776](https://github.com/operator-framework/operator-sdk/pull/776))

### Changed

- The SDK's Kubernetes Golang dependency versions/revisions have been updated from `v1.11.2` to `v1.12.3`. ([#807](https://github.com/operator-framework/operator-sdk/pull/807))
- The controller-runtime version has been updated from `v0.1.4` to `v0.1.8`. See the `v0.1.8` [release notes](https://github.com/kubernetes-sigs/controller-runtime/releases/tag/v0.1.8) for details.
- The SDK now generates the CRD with the status subresource enabled by default. See the [client doc](https://github.com/operator-framework/operator-sdk/blob/master/doc/user/client.md#updating-status-subresource) on how to update the status subresource. ([#787](https://github.com/operator-framework/operator-sdk/pull/787))

### Deprecated

### Removed

### Bug Fixes

## v0.2.1

### Bug Fixes

- Pin controller-runtime version to v0.1.4 to fix dependency issues and pin ansible idna package to version 2.7 ([#831](https://github.com/operator-framework/operator-sdk/pull/831))

## v0.2.0

### Changed

- The SDK now uses logr as the default logger to unify the logging output with the controller-runtime logs. Users can still use a logger of their own choice. See the [logging doc](https://github.com/operator-framework/operator-sdk/blob/master/doc/user/logging.md) on how the SDK initializes and uses logr.
- Ansible Operator CR status better aligns with [conventions](https://github.com/kubernetes/community/blob/master/contributors/devel/sig-architecture/api-conventions.md#typical-status-properties). ([#639](https://github.com/operator-framework/operator-sdk/pull/639))

### Added

- A new command [`operator-sdk print-deps`](https://github.com/operator-framework/operator-sdk/blob/master/doc/sdk-cli-reference.md#print-deps) which prints Golang packages and versions expected by the current Operator SDK version. Supplying `--as-file` prints packages and versions in Gopkg.toml format. ([#772](https://github.com/operator-framework/operator-sdk/pull/772))
- Add [`cluster-scoped`](https://github.com/operator-framework/operator-sdk/blob/master/doc/user-guide.md#operator-scope) flag to `operator-sdk new` command ([#747](https://github.com/operator-framework/operator-sdk/pull/747))
- Add [`up-local`](https://github.com/operator-framework/operator-sdk/blob/master/doc/sdk-cli-reference.md#flags-9) flag to `test local` subcommand ([#781](https://github.com/operator-framework/operator-sdk/pull/781))
- Add [`no-setup`](https://github.com/operator-framework/operator-sdk/blob/master/doc/sdk-cli-reference.md#flags-9) flag to `test local` subcommand ([#770](https://github.com/operator-framework/operator-sdk/pull/770))
- Add [`image`](https://github.com/operator-framework/operator-sdk/blob/master/doc/sdk-cli-reference.md#flags-9) flag to `test local` subcommand ([#768](https://github.com/operator-framework/operator-sdk/pull/768))
- Ansible Operator log output includes much more information for troubleshooting ansible errors. ([#713](https://github.com/operator-framework/operator-sdk/pull/713))
- Ansible Operator periodic reconciliation can be disabled ([#739](https://github.com/operator-framework/operator-sdk/pull/739))

- Ansible Operator "--kubeconfig" command line option fixed ([#705](https://github.com/operator-framework/operator-sdk/pull/705))

## v0.1.1

### Bug fixes
- Fix hardcoded CRD version in crd scaffold ([#690](https://github.com/operator-framework/operator-sdk/pull/690))

## v0.1.0

### Changed

- Use [controller runtime](https://github.com/kubernetes-sigs/controller-runtime) library for controller and client APIs

### Changed

- Moved the rendering of `deploy/operator.yaml` to the `operator-sdk new` command instead of `operator-sdk build`

## v0.0.6

### Added

- Added `operator-sdk up` command to help deploy an operator. Currently supports running an operator locally against an existing cluster e.g `operator-sdk up local --kubeconfig=<path-to-kubeconfig> --namespace=<operator-namespace>`. See `operator-sdk up -h` for help. [#219](https://github.com/operator-framework/operator-sdk/pull/219) [#274](https://github.com/operator-framework/operator-sdk/pull/274)
- Added initial default metrics to be captured and exposed by Prometheus. [#323](https://github.com/operator-framework/operator-sdk/pull/323) exposes the metrics port and [#349](https://github.com/operator-framework/operator-sdk/pull/323) adds the initial default metrics.
- Added initial test framework for operators [#377](https://github.com/operator-framework/operator-sdk/pull/377), [#392](https://github.com/operator-framework/operator-sdk/pull/392), [#393](https://github.com/operator-framework/operator-sdk/pull/393)

### Changed

[#242](https://github.com/operator-framework/operator-sdk/pull/242)
- The SDK exposes the Kubernetes clientset via `k8sclient.GetKubeClient()` #295
- The SDK now vendors the k8s code-generators for an operator instead of using the prebuilt image `gcr.io/coreos-k8s-scale-testing/codegen:1.9.3` [#319](https://github.com/operator-framework/operator-sdk/pull/242)
- The SDK exposes the Kubernetes rest config via `k8sclient.GetKubeConfig()` #338
- Use `time.Duration` instead of `int` for `sdk.Watch` [#427](https://github.com/operator-framework/operator-sdk/pull/427)

### Fixed

- The cache of available clients is being reset every minute for discovery of newely added resources to a cluster. [#280](https://github.com/operator-framework/operator-sdk/pull/280)
