## Unreleased

### Added

- The flag `--watch-namespace` and `--operator-namespace` was added to `operator-sdk run --local`, `operator-sdk test --local` and `operator-sdk cleanup` commands in order to replace the flag `--namespace` which was  deprecated.([#2617](https://github.com/operator-framework/operator-sdk/pull/2617))
- The methods `ctx.GetOperatorNamespace()` and `ctx.GetWatchNamespace()` was added `pkg/test` in order to replace `ctx.GetNamespace()` which is  deprecated. ([#2617](https://github.com/operator-framework/operator-sdk/pull/2617))
- The `--crd-version` flag was added to the `new`, `add api`, `add crd`, and `generate crds` commands so that users can opt-in to `v1` CRDs. ([#2684](https://github.com/operator-framework/operator-sdk/pull/2684))

### Changed

- The scorecard when creating a Custom Resource, will produce a message to the user if that CR already exists. ([#2683](https://github.com/operator-framework/operator-sdk/pull/2683))

### Deprecated

- **Breaking Change:** The `--namespace` flag from `operator-sdk run --local`, `operator-sdk test --local` and `operator-sdk cleanup` command was deprecated and will be removed in the future versions. Use `--watch-namespace` and `--operator-namespace`  instead of. ([#2617](https://github.com/operator-framework/operator-sdk/pull/2617))
- **Breaking Change:** The method `ctx.GetNamespace()` from the `pkg/test` is deprecated and will be removed in the future versions. Use `ctx.GetOperatorNamespace()` and `ctx.GetWatchNamespace()` instead of. ([#2617](https://github.com/operator-framework/operator-sdk/pull/2617))

### Removed

- **Breaking Change:** remove `pkg/restmapper` which was deprecated in `v0.14.0`. Projects that use this package must switch to the `DynamicRESTMapper` implementation in [controller-runtime](https://godoc.org/github.com/kubernetes-sigs/controller-runtime/pkg/client/apiutil#NewDynamicRESTMapper). ([#2544](https://github.com/operator-framework/operator-sdk/pull/2544))

## v0.16.0

### Added

- Add a new option to set the minimum log level that triggers stack trace generation in logs (`--zap-stacktrace-level`) ([#2319](https://github.com/operator-framework/operator-sdk/pull/2319))
- Added `pkg/status` with several new types and interfaces that can be used in `Status` structs to simplify handling of [status conditions](https://github.com/kubernetes/community/blob/master/contributors/devel/sig-architecture/api-conventions.md#typical-status-properties). ([#1143](https://github.com/operator-framework/operator-sdk/pull/1143))
- Added support for relative Ansible roles and playbooks paths in the Ansible-based operator watches files. ([#2273](https://github.com/operator-framework/operator-sdk/pull/2273))
- Added watches file support for roles that were installed as Ansible collections. ([#2587](https://github.com/operator-framework/operator-sdk/pull/2587))
- Add Prometheus metrics support to Ansible-based operators. ([#2179](https://github.com/operator-framework/operator-sdk/pull/2179))
- On `generate csv`, populate a CSV manifestâ€™s `spec.icon`, `spec.keywords`, and `spec.mantainers` fields with empty values to better inform users how to add data. ([#2521](https://github.com/operator-framework/operator-sdk/pull/2521))
- Scaffold code in `cmd/manager/main.go` for Go operators and add logic to Ansible/Helm operators to handle [multinamespace caching](https://godoc.org/github.com/kubernetes-sigs/controller-runtime/pkg/cache#MultiNamespacedCacheBuilder) if `WATCH_NAMESPACE` contains multiple namespaces. ([#2522](https://github.com/operator-framework/operator-sdk/pull/2522))
- Add a new flag option (`--skip-cleanup-error`) to the test framework to allow skip the function which will remove all artefacts when an error be faced to perform this operation.   ([#2512](https://github.com/operator-framework/operator-sdk/pull/2512))
- Add event stats output to the operator logs for Ansible based-operators. ([2580](https://github.com/operator-framework/operator-sdk/pull/2580))
- Improve Ansible logs by allowing output the full Ansible result for Ansible based-operators configurable by environment variable. ([2589](https://github.com/operator-framework/operator-sdk/pull/2589))
- Add the --max-workers flag to the commands operator-sdk exec-entrypoint and operator-sdk run --local for Helm based-operators with the purpose of controling the number of concurrent reconcile workers. ([2607](https://github.com/operator-framework/operator-sdk/pull/2607))

### Changed
- The base image now includes version 0.10.3 of the OpenShift Python client. This should fix hanging in Python3
- The Kubernetes modules have migrated to the [Kubernetes Ansible collection](https://github.com/ansible-collections/kubernetes). All scaffolded code now references modules from this collection instead of Ansible Core. No immediate action is required for existing users of the modules from core, though it is recommended they switch to using the collection to continue to get non-critical bugfixes and features. To install the collection, users will need to add the install step to their `build/Dockerfile`.  New projects will have a `requirements.yml` scaffolded that includes the `community.kubernetes` collection, as well as the corresponding install step in the `build/Dockerfile`. ([#2646](https://github.com/operator-framework/operator-sdk/pull/2646))
- **Breaking change** `The operator_sdk.util` collection is no longer installed by default in the base image. Existing projects will need to install it in the `build/Dockerfile`. New projects will have a `requirements.yml` scaffolded that includes the `operator_sdk.util` collection, as well as the corresponding install step in the `build/Dockerfile`. ([#2652](https://github.com/operator-framework/operator-sdk/pull/2652))
- Ansible scaffolding has been rewritten to be simpler and make use of newer features of Ansible and Molecule. ([#2425](https://github.com/operator-framework/operator-sdk/pull/2425))
    - No longer generates the build/test-framework directory or molecule/test-cluster scenario
    - Adds new `cluster` scenario that can be used to test against an existing cluster
    - There is no longer any Ansible templating done in the `deploy/` directory, any templates used for testing will be located in `molecule/templates/` instead.
    - The scaffolded molecule.yml files now use the Ansible verifier. All asserts.yml files were renamed to verify.yml to reflect this.
    - The prepare/converge/verify tasks now make use of the new `k8s` `wait` option to simplify the deployment logic.
- Operator user setup and entrypoint scripts no longer insert dynamic runtime user entries into `/etc/passwd`. To use dynamic runtime users, use a container runtime that supports it (e.g. CRI-O). ([#2469](https://github.com/operator-framework/operator-sdk/pull/2469))
- Changed the scorecard basic test, `Writing into CRs has an effect`, to include the http.MethodPatch as part of its test criteria alongside http.MethodPut and http.MethodPost. ([#2509](https://github.com/operator-framework/operator-sdk/pull/2509))
- Changed the scorecard to use the init-timeout configuration setting as a wait time when performing cleanup instead of a hard-coded time.  ([#2597](https://github.com/operator-framework/operator-sdk/pull/2597))
- Upgrade the Helm dependency version from `v3.0.1` to `v3.0.2`. ([#2621](https://github.com/operator-framework/operator-sdk/pull/2621))
- Changed the scaffolded `serveCRMetrics` to use the namespaces informed in the environment variable `WATCH_NAMESPACE` in the MultiNamespace scenario. ([#2603](https://github.com/operator-framework/operator-sdk/pull/2603))
- Improve skip metrics logs when running the operator locally in order to make clear the information for Helm based operators. ([#2603](https://github.com/operator-framework/operator-sdk/pull/2603))

### Deprecated
- The type name `TestCtx` in `pkg/test` has been deprecated and renamed to `Context`. It now exists only as a type alias to maintain backwards compatibility. Users of the e2e framework should migrate to use the new name, `Context`. The `TestCtx` alias will be removed in a future version. ([2549](https://github.com/operator-framework/operator-sdk/pull/2549))

- The additional of the dependency `inotify-tools` on Ansible based-operator images. ([#2586](https://github.com/operator-framework/operator-sdk/pull/2586))
-  **Breaking Change:** The scorecard feature now only supports YAML config files. So, any config file with other extension is deprecated and should be changed for the YAML format. For further information see [`scorecard config file`](./doc/test-framework/scorecard.md#config-file) ([#2591](https://github.com/operator-framework/operator-sdk/pull/2591))

### Removed

-  **Breaking Change:** The additional Ansible sidecar container. ([#2586](https://github.com/operator-framework/operator-sdk/pull/2586))

- Fix `ServiceMonitor` creation when the operator is cluster-scoped and the environment variable `WATCH_NAMESPACE` has a different value than the namespace where the operator is deployed. ([#2601](https://github.com/operator-framework/operator-sdk/pull/2601))
- Fix error faced when the `ansible.operator-sdk/verbosity` annotation for Ansible based-operators is 0 or less. ([#2651](https://github.com/operator-framework/operator-sdk/pull/2651))
- Fix missing error status when the error faced in the Ansible do not return an event status. ([#2661](https://github.com/operator-framework/operator-sdk/pull/2661))

## v0.15.2

### Changed
- Operator user setup and entrypoint scripts no longer insert dynamic runtime user entries into `/etc/passwd`. To use dynamic runtime users, use a container runtime that supports it (e.g. CRI-O). ([#2469](https://github.com/operator-framework/operator-sdk/pull/2469))

### Bug Fixes

These commands currently interact with OLM via an in-cluster registry-server created using an operator's on-disk manifests and managed by `operator-sdk`. ([#2402](https://github.com/operator-framework/operator-sdk/pull/2402), [#2441](https://github.com/operator-framework/operator-sdk/pull/2441))
- Added [`bundle create`](./doc/cli/operator-sdk_bundle_create.md) which builds, and optionally generates metadata for, [operator bundle images](https://github.com/openshift/enhancements/blob/ec2cf96/enhancements/olm/operator-registry.md). ([#2076](https://github.com/operator-framework/operator-sdk/pull/2076), [#2438](https://github.com/operator-framework/operator-sdk/pull/2438))
- Added [`bundle validate`](./doc/cli/operator-sdk_bundle_validate.md) which validates [operator bundle images](https://github.com/openshift/enhancements/blob/ec2cf96/enhancements/olm/operator-registry.md). ([#2411](https://github.com/operator-framework/operator-sdk/pull/2411))
- Added `blacklist` field to the `watches.yaml` for Ansible based operators. Blacklisted secondary resources will not be watched or cached.([#2374](https://github.com/operator-framework/operator-sdk/pull/2374))

### Changed

- Changed error wrapping according to Go version 1.13+ [error handling](https://blog.golang.org/go1.13-errors). ([#2355](https://github.com/operator-framework/operator-sdk/pull/2355))

- **Breaking Change:** Moved `olm-catalog gen-csv` to the `generate csv` subcommand. ([#2439](https://github.com/operator-framework/operator-sdk/pull/2439))
- **Breaking Change:** `run ansible/helm` are now the hidden commands `exec-entrypoint ansible/helm`. All functionality of each subcommand is the same. ([#2441](https://github.com/operator-framework/operator-sdk/pull/2441))
- **Breaking Change:** `up local` is now [`run --local`](./doc/cli/operator-sdk_run.md). All functionality of this command is the same. ([#2441](https://github.com/operator-framework/operator-sdk/pull/2441))
- **Breaking Change:** Moved the `olm` subcommand from `alpha` to its own subcommand. All functionality of this command is the same. ([#2447](https://github.com/operator-framework/operator-sdk/pull/2447))

### Deprecated

### Removed

### Bug Fixes

- Fixed a regression in the helm-operator that caused all releases to be deployed in the same namespace that the operator was deployed in, regardless of which namespace the CR was created in. Now release resources are created in the same namespace as the CR. ([#2414](https://github.com/operator-framework/operator-sdk/pull/2414))
- Fix issue when the test-framework would attempt to create a namespace exceeding 63 characters. `pkg/test/NewCtx()` now creates a unique id instead of using the test name. `TestCtx.GetNamespace()` uses this unique id to create a namespace that avoids this scenario. ([#2335](https://github.com/operator-framework/operator-sdk/pull/2335))

## v0.14.1

### Bug Fixes

- Fixed a regression in the helm-operator that caused all releases to be deployed in the same namespace that the operator was deployed in, regardless of which namespace the CR was created in. Now release resources are created in the same namespace as the CR. ([#2414](https://github.com/operator-framework/operator-sdk/pull/2414))

- Updated `pkg/test/e2eutil.WaitForDeployment()` and `pkg/test/e2eutil.WaitForOperatorDeployment()` to successfully complete waiting when the available replica count is _at least_ (rather than exactly) the minimum replica count required. ([#2248](https://github.com/operator-framework/operator-sdk/pull/2248))
- Replace in the Ansible based operators module tests `k8s_info` for `k8s_facts` which is deprecated. ([#2168](https://github.com/operator-framework/operator-sdk/issues/2168))

### Deprecated

- Deprecated the `operator-sdk generate openapi` command. CRD generation is still supported with `operator-sdk generate crds`. It is now recommended to use [openapi-gen](https://github.com/kubernetes/kube-openapi/tree/master/cmd/openapi-gen) directly for OpenAPI code generation. The `generate openapi` subcommand will be removed in a future release. ([#2276](https://github.com/operator-framework/operator-sdk/pull/2276))

- Added missing default role permission for `deployments`, which is required to create the metrics service for the operator. ([#2090](https://github.com/operator-framework/operator-sdk/pull/2090))
- Handle invalid maxArtifacts annotation on CRs for Ansible based operators. ([2093](https://github.com/operator-framework/operator-sdk/pull/2093))
- When validating package manifests, only return an error if default channel is not set and more than one channel is available. ([#2116](https://github.com/operator-framework/operator-sdk/pull/2116))

## v0.11.0

### Added

- Added support for event filtering for ansible operator. ([#1968](https://github.com/operator-framework/operator-sdk/issues/1968))
- Added new `--skip-generation` flag to the `operator-sdk add api` command to support skipping generation of deepcopy and OpenAPI code and OpenAPI CRD specs. ([#1890](https://github.com/operator-framework/operator-sdk/pull/1890))
- The `operator-sdk olm-catalog gen-csv` command now produces indented JSON for the `alm-examples` annotation. ([#1793](https://github.com/operator-framework/operator-sdk/pull/1793))
- Added flag `--dep-manager` to command [`operator-sdk print-deps`](https://github.com/operator-framework/operator-sdk/blob/v0.11.0/doc/sdk-cli-reference.md#print-deps) to specify the type of dependency manager file to print. The choice of dependency manager is inferred from top-level dependency manager files present if `--dep-manager` is not set. ([#1819](https://github.com/operator-framework/operator-sdk/pull/1819))
- Ansible based operators now gather and serve metrics about each custom resource on port 8686 of the metrics service. ([#1723](https://github.com/operator-framework/operator-sdk/pull/1723))
- Added the Go version, OS, and architecture to the output of `operator-sdk version` ([#1863](https://github.com/operator-framework/operator-sdk/pull/1863))
- Added support for `ppc64le-linux` for the `operator-sdk` binary and the Helm operator base image. ([#1533](https://github.com/operator-framework/operator-sdk/pull/1533))
- Added new `--version` flag to the `operator-sdk scorecard` command to support a new output format for the scorecard. ([#1916](https://github.com/operator-framework/operator-sdk/pull/1916)
- Added new `--selector` flag to the `operator-sdk scorecard` command to support filtering scorecard tests based on labels added to each test. ([#1916](https://github.com/operator-framework/operator-sdk/pull/1916)
- Added new `--list` flag to the `operator-sdk scorecard` command to support listing scorecard tests that would be executed based on selector filters. ([#1916](https://github.com/operator-framework/operator-sdk/pull/1916)
- For scorecard version v1alpha2 only, return code logic was added to return 1 if any of the selected scorecard tests fail.  A return code of 0 is returned if all selected tests pass. ([#1916](https://github.com/operator-framework/operator-sdk/pull/1916)

### Changed

- The Helm operator now uses the CR name for the release name for newly created CRs. Existing CRs will continue to use their existing UID-based release name. When a release name collision occurs (when CRs of different types share the same name), the second CR will fail to install with an error about a duplicate name. ([#1818](https://github.com/operator-framework/operator-sdk/pull/1818))
- Commands [`olm uninstall`](https://github.com/operator-framework/operator-sdk/blob/v0.11.0/doc/sdk-cli-reference.md#uninstall) and [`olm status`](https://github.com/operator-framework/operator-sdk/blob/v0.11.0/doc/sdk-cli-reference.md#status) no longer use a `--version` flag to specify OLM version. This information is now retrieved from the running cluster. ([#1634](https://github.com/operator-framework/operator-sdk/pull/1634))
- The Helm operator no longer prints manifest diffs in the operator log at verbosity levels lower than INFO ([#1857](https://github.com/operator-framework/operator-sdk/pull/1857))
- CRD manifest `spec.version` is still supported, but users will see a warning message if `spec.versions` is not present and an error if `spec.versions` is populated but the version in `spec.version` is not in `spec.versions`. ([#1876](https://github.com/operator-framework/operator-sdk/pull/1876))
- Upgrade base image for Go, Helm, and scorecard proxy from `registry.access.redhat.com/ubi7/ubi-minimal:latest` to `registry.access.redhat.com/ubi8/ubi-minimal:latest`. ([#1952](https://github.com/operator-framework/operator-sdk/pull/1952))
- Upgrade base image for Ansible from `registry.access.redhat.com/ubi7/ubi:latest` to `registry.access.redhat.com/ubi8/ubi:latest`. ([#1990](https://github.com/operator-framework/operator-sdk/pull/1990) and [#2004](https://github.com/operator-framework/operator-sdk/pull/2004))
- Updated kube-state-metrics dependency from `v1.6.0` to `v1.7.2`. ([#1943](https://github.com/operator-framework/operator-sdk/pull/1943))

### Breaking changes

- Upgrade Kubernetes version from `kubernetes-1.13.4` to `kubernetes-1.14.1` ([#1876](https://github.com/operator-framework/operator-sdk/pull/1876))
- Upgrade `github.com/operator-framework/operator-lifecycle-manager` version from `b8a4faf68e36feb6d99a6aec623b405e587b17b1` to `0.10.1` ([#1876](https://github.com/operator-framework/operator-sdk/pull/1876))
- Upgrade [`controller-runtime`](https://github.com/kubernetes-sigs/controller-runtime) version from `v0.1.12` to `v0.2.0` ([#1876](https://github.com/operator-framework/operator-sdk/pull/1876))
  - The package `sigs.k8s.io/controller-runtime/pkg/runtime/scheme` is deprecated, and contains no code. Replace this import with `sigs.k8s.io/controller-runtime/pkg/scheme` where relevant.
  - The package `sigs.k8s.io/controller-runtime/pkg/runtime/log` is deprecated. Replace this import with `sigs.k8s.io/controller-runtime/pkg/log` where relevant.
  - The package `sigs.k8s.io/controller-runtime/pkg/runtime/signals` is deprecated. Replace this import with `sigs.k8s.io/controller-runtime/pkg/manager/signals` where relevant.
  - All methods on [`sigs.k8s.io/controller-runtime/pkg/client.Client`](https://github.com/kubernetes-sigs/controller-runtime/blob/v0.2.0/pkg/client/interfaces.go#L104) (except for `Get()`) have been updated. Instead of each using a `struct`-typed or variadic functional option parameter, or having no option parameter, each now uses a variadic interface option parameter typed for each method. See `List()` below for an example.
  - [`sigs.k8s.io/controller-runtime/pkg/client.Client`](https://github.com/kubernetes-sigs/controller-runtime/blob/v0.2.0/pkg/client/interfaces.go#L104)'s `List()` method signature has been updated: `List(ctx context.Context, opts *client.ListOptions, list runtime.Object) error` is now [`List(ctx context.Context, list runtime.Object, opts ...client.ListOption) error`](https://github.com/kubernetes-sigs/controller-runtime/blob/v0.2.0/pkg/client/interfaces.go#L61). To migrate:
      ```go
      import (
        "context"

        "sigs.k8s.io/controller-runtime/pkg/client"
      )

      ...

      // Old
      listOpts := &client.ListOptions{}
      listOpts.InNamespace("namespace")
      err = r.client.List(context.TODO(), listOps, podList)
      // New
      listOpts := []client.ListOption{
        client.InNamespace("namespace"),
      }
      err = r.client.List(context.TODO(), podList, listOpts...)
      ```
- [`pkg/test.FrameworkClient`](https://github.com/operator-framework/operator-sdk/blob/master/pkg/test/client.go#L33) methods `List()` and `Delete()` have new signatures corresponding to the homonymous methods of `sigs.k8s.io/controller-runtime/pkg/client.Client`. ([#1876](https://github.com/operator-framework/operator-sdk/pull/1876))
- CRD file names were previously of the form `<group>_<version>_<kind>_crd.yaml`. Now that CRD manifest `spec.version` is deprecated in favor of `spec.versions`, i.e. multiple versions can be specified in one CRD, CRD file names have the form `<full group>_<resource>_crd.yaml`. `<full group>` is the full group name of your CRD while `<group>` is the last subdomain of `<full group>`, ex. `foo.bar.com` vs `foo`. `<resource>` is the plural lower-case CRD Kind found at `spec.names.plural`. ([#1876](https://github.com/operator-framework/operator-sdk/pull/1876))
- Upgrade Python version from `2.7` to `3.6`, Ansible version from `2.8.0` to `~=2.8` and ansible-runner from `1.2` to `1.3.4` in the Ansible based images. ([#1947](https://github.com/operator-framework/operator-sdk/pull/1947))
- Made the default scorecard version `v1alpha2` which is new for this release and could break users that were parsing the older scorecard output (`v1alpha1`).  Users can still specify version `v1alpha1` on the scorecard configuration to use the older style for some period of time until `v1alpha1` is removed.
- Replaced `pkg/kube-metrics.NewCollectors()` with `pkg/kube-metrics.NewMetricsStores()` and changed exported function signature for `pkg/kube-metrics.ServeMetrics()` due to a [breaking change in kube-state-metrics](https://github.com/kubernetes/kube-state-metrics/pull/786). ([#1943](https://github.com/operator-framework/operator-sdk/pull/1943))

### Deprecated

### Removed

- Removed flag `--as-file` from command [`operator-sdk print-deps`](https://github.com/operator-framework/operator-sdk/blob/v0.11.0/doc/sdk-cli-reference.md#print-deps), which now only prints packages and versions in dependency manager file format. The choice of dependency manager type is set by `--dep-manager` or inferred from top-level dependency manager files present if `--dep-manager` is not set. ([#1819](https://github.com/operator-framework/operator-sdk/pull/1819))

### Bug Fixes

- Configure the repo path correctly in `operator-sdk add crd` and prevent the command from running outside of an operator project. ([#1660](https://github.com/operator-framework/operator-sdk/pull/1660))
- In the Helm operator, skip owner reference injection for cluster-scoped resources in release manifests. The Helm operator only supports namespace-scoped CRs, and namespaced resources cannot own cluster-scoped resources. ([#1817](https://github.com/operator-framework/operator-sdk/pull/1817))
- Package manifests generated with [`gen-csv`](https://github.com/operator-framework/operator-sdk/blob/v0.11.0/doc/sdk-cli-reference.md#gen-csv) respect the `--operator-name` flag, channel names are checked for duplicates before (re-)generation. ([#1693](https://github.com/operator-framework/operator-sdk/pull/1693))
- Generated inventory for Ansible-based Operators now sets the localhost's `ansible_python_interpreter` to `{{ ansible_playbook_python }}`, to properly match the [implicit localhost](https://docs.ansible.com/ansible/latest/inventory/implicit_localhost.html). ([#1952](https://github.com/operator-framework/operator-sdk/pull/1952))
- Fixed an issue in `operator-sdk olm-catalog gen-csv` where the generated CSV is missing the expected set of owned CRDs. ([#2017](https://github.com/operator-framework/operator-sdk/pull/2017))
- The command `operator-sdk olm-catalog gen-csv --csv-version=<version> --update-crds` would fail to copy over CRD manifests into `deploy/olm-catalog` for manifests whose name didn't end with a `_crd.yaml` suffix. This has been fixed so `gen-csv` now copies all CRD manifests specified by `deploy/olm-catalog/csv_config.yaml` by checking the type of the manifest rather than the filename suffix. ([#2015](https://github.com/operator-framework/operator-sdk/pull/2015))
- Added missing `jmespath` dependency to Ansible-based Operator .travis.yml file template. ([#2027](https://github.com/operator-framework/operator-sdk/pull/2027))
- Fixed invalid usage of `logr.Logger.Info()` in the Ansible-based operator implementation, which caused unnecessary operator panics. ([#2031](https://github.com/operator-framework/operator-sdk/pull/2031))

## v0.10.0

### Added

- Document new compile-time dependency `mercurial` in user-facing documentation. ([#1683](https://github.com/operator-framework/operator-sdk/pull/1683))
- Adds new flag `--zap-time-encoding` to the flagset provided by `pkg/log/zap`. This flag configures the timestamp format produced by the zap logger. See the [logging doc](https://github.com/operator-framework/operator-sdk/blob/master/doc/user/logging.md) for more information. ([#1529](https://github.com/operator-framework/operator-sdk/pull/1529))

### Changed

- **Breaking Change:** New configuration format for the `operator-sdk scorecard` using config files. See [`doc/test-framework/scorecard`](doc/test-framework/scorecard.md) for more info ([#1641](https://github.com/operator-framework/operator-sdk/pull/1641))
- **Breaking change:** CSV config field `role-path` is now `role-paths` and takes a list of strings. Users can now specify multiple `Role` and `ClusterRole` manifests using `role-paths`. ([#1704](https://github.com/operator-framework/operator-sdk/pull/1704))
- Make `ready` package idempotent. Now, a user can call `Set()` or `Unset()` to set the operator's readiness without knowing the current state. ([#1761](https://github.com/operator-framework/operator-sdk/pull/1761))

### Bug Fixes

- Check if `metadata.annotations['alm-examples']` is non-empty before creating contained CR manifests in the scorecard. ([#1789](https://github.com/operator-framework/operator-sdk/pull/1789))

## v0.9.0

### Added

- Adds support for building OCI images with [podman](https://podman.io/), e.g. `operator-sdk build --image-builder=podman`. ([#1488](https://github.com/operator-framework/operator-sdk/pull/1488))
- New option for [`operator-sdk up local --enable-delve`](https://github.com/operator-framework/operator-sdk/blob/v0.9.0/doc/sdk-cli-reference.md#up), which can be used to start the operator in remote debug mode with the [delve](https://github.com/go-delve/delve) debugger listening on port 2345. ([#1422](https://github.com/operator-framework/operator-sdk/pull/1422))
- Enables controller-runtime metrics in Helm operator projects. ([#1482](https://github.com/operator-framework/operator-sdk/pull/1482))
- New flags `--vendor` and `--skip-validation` for [`operator-sdk new`](https://github.com/operator-framework/operator-sdk/blob/v0.9.0/doc/sdk-cli-reference.md#new) that direct the SDK to initialize a new project with a `vendor/` directory, and without validating project dependencies. `vendor/` is not written by default. ([#1519](https://github.com/operator-framework/operator-sdk/pull/1519))
- Generating and serving info metrics about each custom resource. By default these metrics are exposed on port 8686. ([#1277](https://github.com/operator-framework/operator-sdk/pull/1277))
- Scaffold a `pkg/apis/<group>/group.go` package file to avoid `go/build` errors when running Kubernetes code generators. ([#1401](https://github.com/operator-framework/operator-sdk/pull/1401))
- Adds a new extra variable containing the unmodified CR spec for ansible based operators. [#1563](https://github.com/operator-framework/operator-sdk/pull/1563)
- New flag `--repo` for subcommands [`new`](https://github.com/operator-framework/operator-sdk/blob/v0.9.0/doc/sdk-cli-reference.md#new) and [`migrate`](https://github.com/operator-framework/operator-sdk/blob/v0.9.0/doc/sdk-cli-reference.md#migrate) specifies the repository path to be used in Go source files generated by the SDK. This flag can only be used with [Go modules](https://github.com/golang/go/wiki/Modules). ([#1475](https://github.com/operator-framework/operator-sdk/pull/1475))
- Adds `--go-build-args` flag to `operator-sdk build` for providing additional Go build arguments. ([#1582](https://github.com/operator-framework/operator-sdk/pull/1582))
- New flags `--csv-channel` and `--default-channel` for subcommand [`gen-csv`](https://github.com/operator-framework/operator-sdk/blob/v0.9.0/doc/sdk-cli-reference.md#gen-csv) that add channels to and update the [package manifest](https://github.com/operator-framework/operator-registry/#manifest-format) in `deploy/olm-catalog/<operator-name>` when generating a new CSV or updating an existing one. ([#1364](https://github.com/operator-framework/operator-sdk/pull/1364))
- Adds `go.mod` and `go.sum` to switch from `dep` to [Go modules](https://github.com/golang/go/wiki/Modules) to manage dependencies for the SDK project itself. ([#1566](https://github.com/operator-framework/operator-sdk/pull/1566))
- New flag `--operator-name` for [`operator-sdk olm-catalog gen-csv`](https://github.com/operator-framework/operator-sdk/blob/v0.9.0/doc/sdk-cli-reference.md#gen-csv) to specify the operator name, ex. `memcached-operator`, to use in CSV generation. The project's name is used (old behavior) if `--operator-name` is not set. ([#1571](https://github.com/operator-framework/operator-sdk/pull/1571))
- New flag `--local-operator-flags` for `operator-sdk test local --up-local` to specify flags to run a local operator with during a test. ([#1509](https://github.com/operator-framework/operator-sdk/pull/1509))

### Changed

- Upgrade the version of the dependency [controller-runtime](https://github.com/kubernetes-sigs/controller-runtime) from `v0.1.10` to `v0.1.12`. ([#1612](https://github.com/operator-framework/operator-sdk/pull/1612))
- Remove TypeMeta declaration from the implementation of the objects ([#1462](https://github.com/operator-framework/operator-sdk/pull/1462/))
- Relaxed API version format check when parsing `pkg/apis` in code generators. API dir structures can now be of the format `pkg/apis/<group>/<anything>`, where `<anything>` was previously required to be in the Kubernetes version format, ex. `v1alpha1`. ([#1525](https://github.com/operator-framework/operator-sdk/pull/1525))
- The SDK and operator projects will work outside of `$GOPATH/src` when using [Go modules](https://github.com/golang/go/wiki/Modules). ([#1475](https://github.com/operator-framework/operator-sdk/pull/1475))
-  `CreateMetricsService()` function from the metrics package accepts a REST config (\*rest.Config) and an array of ServicePort objects ([]v1.ServicePort) as input to create Service metrics. `CRPortName` constant is added to describe the string of custom resource port name. ([#1560](https://github.com/operator-framework/operator-sdk/pull/1560) and [#1626](https://github.com/operator-framework/operator-sdk/pull/1626))
- Changed the flag `--skip-git-init` to [`--git-init`](https://github.com/operator-framework/operator-sdk/blob/v0.9.0/doc/sdk-cli-reference.md#new). This changes the default behavior of `operator-sdk new` to not initialize the new project directory as a git repository with `git init`. This behavior is now opt-in with `--git-init`. ([#1588](https://github.com/operator-framework/operator-sdk/pull/1588))
- `operator-sdk new` will no longer create the initial commit for a new project, even with `--git-init=true`. ([#1588](https://github.com/operator-framework/operator-sdk/pull/1588))
- When errors occur setting up the Kubernetes client for RBAC role generation, `operator-sdk new --type=helm` now falls back to a default RBAC role instead of failing. ([#1627](https://github.com/operator-framework/operator-sdk/pull/1627))

### Removed

- The SDK no longer depends on a `vendor/` directory to manage dependencies *only if* using [Go modules](https://github.com/golang/go/wiki/Modules). The SDK and operator projects will only use vendoring if using `dep`, or modules and a `vendor/` dir is present. ([#1519](https://github.com/operator-framework/operator-sdk/pull/1519))
- **Breaking change:** `ExposeMetricsPort` is removed and replaced with `CreateMetricsService()` function. `PrometheusPortName` constant is replaced with `OperatorPortName`. ([#1560](https://github.com/operator-framework/operator-sdk/pull/1560))
- Removes `Gopkg.toml` and `Gopkg.lock` to drop the use of `dep` in favor of [Go modules](https://github.com/golang/go/wiki/Modules) to manage dependencies for the SDK project itself. ([#1566](https://github.com/operator-framework/operator-sdk/pull/1566))

## v0.8.2

### Bug Fixes

- Fixes header file content validation when the content contains empty lines or centered text. ([#1544](https://github.com/operator-framework/operator-sdk/pull/1544))
- Generated CSV's that include a deployment install strategy will be checked for a reference to `metadata.annotations['olm.targetNamespaces']`, and if one is not found a reference will be added to the `WATCH_NAMESPACE` env var for all containers in the deployment. This is a bug because any other value that references the CSV's namespace is incorrect. ([#1396](https://github.com/operator-framework/operator-sdk/pull/1396))
- Build `-trimpath` was not being respected. `$GOPATH` was not expanding because `exec.Cmd{}` is not executed in a shell environment. ([#1535](https://github.com/operator-framework/operator-sdk/pull/1535))
- Running the [scorecard](https://github.com/operator-framework/operator-sdk/blob/v0.8.2/doc/sdk-cli-reference.md#up) with `--olm-deployed` will now only use the first CR set in either the `cr-manifest` config option or the CSV's `metadata.annotations['alm-examples']` as was intended, and access manifests correctly from the config. ([#1565](https://github.com/operator-framework/operator-sdk/pull/1565))
- Use the correct domain names when generating CRD's instead that of the first CRD to be parsed. ([#1636](https://github.com/operator-framework/operator-sdk/pull/1636))

## v0.8.1

### Bug Fixes

- Fixes a regression that causes Helm RBAC generation to contain an empty custom ruleset when the chart's default manifest contains only namespaced resources. ([#1456](https://github.com/operator-framework/operator-sdk/pull/1456))
- Fixes an issue that causes Helm RBAC generation to fail when creating new operators with a Kubernetes context configured to connect to an OpenShift cluster. ([#1461](https://github.com/operator-framework/operator-sdk/pull/1461))

## v0.8.0

### Added

- New option for [`operator-sdk build --image-builder`](https://github.com/operator-framework/operator-sdk/blob/v0.8.0/doc/sdk-cli-reference.md#build), which can be used to specify which image builder to use. Adds support for [buildah](https://github.com/containers/buildah/). ([#1311](https://github.com/operator-framework/operator-sdk/pull/1311))
- Manager is now configured with a new `DynamicRESTMapper`, which accounts for the fact that the default `RESTMapper`, which only checks resource types at startup, can't handle the case of first creating a CRD and then an instance of that CRD. ([#1329](https://github.com/operator-framework/operator-sdk/pull/1329))
- Unify CLI debug logging under a global `--verbose` flag ([#1361](https://github.com/operator-framework/operator-sdk/pull/1361))
- [Go module](https://github.com/golang/go/wiki/Modules) support by default for new Go operators and during Ansible and Helm operator migration. The dependency manager used for a new operator can be explicitly specified for new operators through the `--dep-manager` flag, available in [`operator-sdk new`](https://github.com/operator-framework/operator-sdk/blob/v0.8.0/doc/sdk-cli-reference.md#new) and [`operator-sdk migrate`](https://github.com/operator-framework/operator-sdk/blob/v0.8.0/doc/sdk-cli-reference.md#migrate). `dep` is still available through `--dep-manager=dep`. ([#1001](https://github.com/operator-framework/operator-sdk/pull/1001))
- New optional flag `--custom-api-import` for [`operator-sdk add controller`](https://github.com/operator-framework/operator-sdk/blob/v0.8.0/doc/sdk-cli-reference.md#controller) to specify that the new controller reconciles a built-in or external Kubernetes API, and what import path and identifier it should have. ([#1344](https://github.com/operator-framework/operator-sdk/pull/1344))
- Operator Scorecard plugin support ([#1379](https://github.com/operator-framework/operator-sdk/pull/1379)). Documentation for scorecard plugins can be found in the main scorecard doc: [doc/test-framework/scorecard.md](./doc/test-framework/scorecard.md)

### Changed

- When Helm operator projects are created, the SDK now generates RBAC rules in `deploy/role.yaml` based on the chart's default manifest. ([#1188](https://github.com/operator-framework/operator-sdk/pull/1188))
- When debug level is 3 or higher, we will set the klog verbosity to that level. ([#1322](https://github.com/operator-framework/operator-sdk/pull/1322))
- Relaxed requirements for groups in new project API's. Groups passed to [`operator-sdk add api`](https://github.com/operator-framework/operator-sdk/blob/v0.8.0/doc/sdk-cli-reference.md#api)'s `--api-version` flag can now have no subdomains, ex `core/v1`. See ([#1191](https://github.com/operator-framework/operator-sdk/issues/1191)) for discussion. ([#1313](https://github.com/operator-framework/operator-sdk/pull/1313))
- Renamed `--docker-build-args` option to `--image-build-args` option for `build` subcommand, because this option can now be shared with other image build tools than docker when `--image-builder` option is specified. ([#1311](https://github.com/operator-framework/operator-sdk/pull/1311))
- Reduces Helm release information in CR status to only the release name and manifest and moves it from `status.conditions` to a new top-level `deployedRelease` field. ([#1309](https://github.com/operator-framework/operator-sdk/pull/1309))
  - **WARNING**: Users with active CRs and releases who are upgrading their helm-based operator should upgrade to one based on v0.7.0 before upgrading further. Helm operators based on v0.8.0+ will not seamlessly transition release state to the persistent backend, and will instead uninstall and reinstall all managed releases.
- Go operator CRDs are overwritten when being regenerated by [`operator-sdk generate openapi`](https://github.com/operator-framework/operator-sdk/blob/v0.8.0/doc/sdk-cli-reference.md#openapi). Users can now rely on `+kubebuilder` annotations in their API code, which provide access to most OpenAPIv3 [validation properties](https://github.com/OAI/OpenAPI-Specification/blob/master/versions/3.0.0.md#schema-object) (the full set will be supported in the near future, see [this PR](https://github.com/kubernetes-sigs/controller-tools/pull/190)) and [other CRD fields](https://book-v1.book.kubebuilder.io/beyond_basics/generating_crd.html). ([#1278](https://github.com/operator-framework/operator-sdk/pull/1278))
- Use `registry.access.redhat.com/ubi7/ubi-minimal:latest` base image for the Go and Helm operators and scorecard proxy ([#1376](https://github.com/operator-framework/operator-sdk/pull/1376))
- Allow "Owned CRDs Have Resources Listed" scorecard test to pass if the resources section exists

### Removed

- The SDK will no longer run `defaulter-gen` on running `operator-sdk generate k8s`. Defaulting for CRDs should be handled with mutating admission webhooks. ([#1288](https://github.com/operator-framework/operator-sdk/pull/1288))
- The `--version` flag was removed. Users should use the `operator-sdk version` command. ([#1444](https://github.com/operator-framework/operator-sdk/pull/1444))
- **Breaking Change**: The `test cluster` subcommand and the corresponding `--enable-tests` flag for the `build` subcommand have been removed ([#1414](https://github.com/operator-framework/operator-sdk/pull/1414))
- **Breaking Change**: The `--cluster-scoped` flag for `operator-sdk new` has been removed so it won't scaffold a cluster-scoped operator. Read the [operator scope](https://github.com/operator-framework/operator-sdk/blob/master/doc/operator-scope.md) documentation on the changes needed to run a cluster-scoped operator. ([#1434](https://github.com/operator-framework/operator-sdk/pull/1434))

### Bug Fixes

- [`operator-sdk generate openapi`](https://github.com/operator-framework/operator-sdk/blob/v0.8.0/doc/sdk-cli-reference.md#openapi) no longer overwrites CRD values derived from `+kubebuilder` annotations in Go API code. See issues ([#1212](https://github.com/operator-framework/operator-sdk/issues/1212)) and ([#1323](https://github.com/operator-framework/operator-sdk/issues/1323)) for discussion. ([#1278](https://github.com/operator-framework/operator-sdk/pull/1278))
- Running [`operator-sdk gen-csv`](https://github.com/operator-framework/operator-sdk/blob/v0.8.0/doc/sdk-cli-reference.md#gen-csv) on operators that do not have a CRDs directory, ex. `deploy/crds`, or do not have any [owned CRDs](https://github.com/operator-framework/operator-lifecycle-manager/blob/master/doc/design/building-your-csv.md#your-custom-resource-definitions), will not generate a "deploy/crds not found" error.

## v0.7.1

### Bug Fixes

- Pin dependency versions in Ansible build and test framework Dockerfiles to fix broken build and test framework images. ([#1348](https://github.com/operator-framework/operator-sdk/pull/1348))
- In Helm-based operators, when a custom resource with a failing release is reverted back to a working state, the `ReleaseFailed` condition is now correctly removed. ([#1321](https://github.com/operator-framework/operator-sdk/pull/1321))

## v0.7.0

### Added

- New optional flag `--header-file` for commands [`operator-sdk generate k8s`](https://github.com/operator-framework/operator-sdk/blob/v0.7.0/doc/sdk-cli-reference.md#k8s) and [`operator-sdk add api`](https://github.com/operator-framework/operator-sdk/blob/v0.7.0/doc/sdk-cli-reference.md#api) to supply a boilerplate header file for generated code. ([#1239](https://github.com/operator-framework/operator-sdk/pull/1239))
- JSON output support for `operator-sdk scorecard` subcommand ([#1228](https://github.com/operator-framework/operator-sdk/pull/1228))

### Changed

- Updated the helm-operator to store release state in kubernetes secrets in the same namespace of the custom resource that defines the release. ([#1102](https://github.com/operator-framework/operator-sdk/pull/1102))
  - **WARNING**: Users with active CRs and releases who are upgrading their helm-based operator should not skip this version. Future versions will not seamlessly transition release state to the persistent backend, and will instead uninstall and reinstall all managed releases.
- Change `namespace-manifest` flag in scorecard subcommand to `namespaced-manifest` to match other subcommands
- Subcommands of [`operator-sdk generate`](https://github.com/operator-framework/operator-sdk/blob/v0.7.0/doc/sdk-cli-reference.md#generate) are now verbose by default. ([#1271](https://github.com/operator-framework/operator-sdk/pull/1271))
- [`operator-sdk olm-catalog gen-csv`](https://github.com/operator-framework/operator-sdk/blob/v0.7.0/doc/sdk-cli-reference.md#gen-csv) parses Custom Resource manifests from `deploy/crds` or a custom path specified in `csv-config.yaml`, encodes them in a JSON array, and sets the CSV's [`metadata.annotations.alm-examples`](https://github.com/operator-framework/operator-lifecycle-manager/blob/master/doc/design/building-your-csv.md#crd-templates) field to that JSON. ([#1116](https://github.com/operator-framework/operator-sdk/pull/1116))

### Bug Fixes

- Fixed an issue that caused `operator-sdk new --type=helm` to fail for charts that have template files in nested template directories. ([#1235](https://github.com/operator-framework/operator-sdk/pull/1235))
- Fix bug in the YAML scanner used by `operator-sdk test` and `operator-sdk scorecard` that could result in a panic if a manifest file started with `---` ([#1258](https://github.com/operator-framework/operator-sdk/pull/1258))

## v0.6.0

### Added

- New flags for [`operator-sdk new --type=helm`](https://github.com/operator-framework/operator-sdk/blob/v0.6.0/doc/sdk-cli-reference.md#new), which can be used to populate the project with an existing chart. ([#949](https://github.com/operator-framework/operator-sdk/pull/949))
- Command [`operator-sdk olm-catalog`](https://github.com/operator-framework/operator-sdk/blob/v0.6.0/doc/sdk-cli-reference.md#olm-catalog) flag `--update-crds` optionally copies CRD's from `deploy/crds` when creating a new CSV or updating an existing CSV, and `--from-version` uses another versioned CSV manifest as a base for a new CSV version. ([#1016](https://github.com/operator-framework/operator-sdk/pull/1016))
- New flag `--olm-deployed` to direct the [`scorecard`](https://github.com/operator-framework/operator-sdk/blob/v0.6.0/doc/sdk-cli-reference.md#scorecard) command to only use the CSV at `--csv-path` for manifest data, except for those provided to `--cr-manifest`. ([#1044](https://github.com/operator-framework/operator-sdk/pull/1044))
- Command [`version`](https://github.com/operator-framework/operator-sdk/pull/1171) prints the version of operator-sdk. ([#1171](https://github.com/operator-framework/operator-sdk/pull/1171))

### Changed

- Changed the Go, Helm, and Scorecard base images to `registry.access.redhat.com/ubi7-dev-preview/ubi-minimal:7.6` ([#1142](https://github.com/operator-framework/operator-sdk/pull/1142))
- CSV manifest are now versioned according to the `operator-registry` [manifest format](https://github.com/operator-framework/operator-registry#manifest-format). See issue [#900](https://github.com/operator-framework/operator-sdk/issues/900) for more details. ([#1016](https://github.com/operator-framework/operator-sdk/pull/1016))
- Unexported `CleanupNoT` function from `pkg/test`, as it is only intended to be used internally ([#1167](https://github.com/operator-framework/operator-sdk/pull/1167))

### Bug Fixes

- Fix issue where running `operator-sdk test local --up-local` would sometimes leave a running process in the background after exit ([#1089](https://github.com/operator-framework/operator-sdk/pull/1020))

## v0.5.0

### Added

- Updated the Kubernetes dependencies to `1.13.1` ([#1020](https://github.com/operator-framework/operator-sdk/pull/1020))
- Updated the controller-runtime version to `v0.1.10`. See the [controller-runtime `v0.1.10` release notes](https://github.com/kubernetes-sigs/controller-runtime/releases/tag/v0.1.10) for new features and bug fixes. ([#1020](https://github.com/operator-framework/operator-sdk/pull/1020))
- By default the controller-runtime metrics are exposed on port 8383. This is done as part of the scaffold in the main.go file, the port can be adjusted by modifying the `metricsPort` variable. [#786](https://github.com/operator-framework/operator-sdk/pull/786)
- A new command [`operator-sdk olm-catalog`](https://github.com/operator-framework/operator-sdk/blob/v0.5.0/doc/sdk-cli-reference.md#olm-catalog) to be used as a parent for SDK subcommands generating code related to Operator Lifecycle Manager (OLM) Catalog integration, and subcommand [`operator-sdk olm-catalog gen-csv`](https://github.com/operator-framework/operator-sdk/blob/v0.5.0/doc/sdk-cli-reference.md#gen-csv) which generates a Cluster Service Version for an operator so the OLM can deploy the operator in a cluster. ([#673](https://github.com/operator-framework/operator-sdk/pull/673))
- Helm-based operators have leader election turned on by default. When upgrading, add environment variable `POD_NAME` to your operator's Deployment using the Kubernetes downward API. To see an example, run `operator-sdk new --type=helm ...` and see file `deploy/operator.yaml`. [#1000](https://github.com/operator-framework/operator-sdk/pull/1000)
- A new command [`operator-sdk generate openapi`](https://github.com/operator-framework/operator-sdk/blob/v0.5.0/doc/sdk-cli-reference.md#openapi) which generates OpenAPIv3 validation specs in Go and in CRD manifests as YAML. ([#869](https://github.com/operator-framework/operator-sdk/pull/869))
- The `operator-sdk add api` command now generates OpenAPIv3 validation specs in Go for that API, and in all CRD manifests as YAML.

### Changed

- In new Helm operator projects, the scaffolded CR `spec` field now contains the default values.yaml from the generated chart. ([#967](https://github.com/operator-framework/operator-sdk/pull/967))

### Deprecated

### Removed

### Bug Fixes

## v0.4.1

### Bug Fixes

- Make `up local` subcommand respect `KUBECONFIG` env var ([#996](https://github.com/operator-framework/operator-sdk/pull/996))
- Make `up local` subcommand use default namespace set in kubeconfig instead of hardcoded `default` and also add ability to watch all namespaces for ansible and helm type operators ([#996](https://github.com/operator-framework/operator-sdk/pull/996))
- Added k8s_status modules back to generation ([#972](https://github.com/operator-framework/operator-sdk/pull/972))
- Update checks for gvk registration to cover all cases for ansible ([#973](https://github.com/operator-framework/operator-sdk/pull/973) & [#1019](https://github.com/operator-framework/operator-sdk/pull/1019))
- Update reconciler for ansible and helm to use the cache rather than the API client. ([#1022](https://github.com/operator-framework/operator-sdk/pull/1022) & [#1048](https://github.com/operator-framework/operator-sdk/pull/1048) & [#1054](https://github.com/operator-framework/operator-sdk/pull/1054))
- Update reconciler to will update the status everytime for ansible ([#1066](https://github.com/operator-framework/operator-sdk/pull/1066))
- Update ansible proxy to recover dependent watches when pod is killed ([#1067](https://github.com/operator-framework/operator-sdk/pull/1067))
- Update ansible proxy to handle watching cluster scoped dependent watches ([#1031](https://github.com/operator-framework/operator-sdk/pull/1031))

## v0.4.0

### Added

- A new command [`operator-sdk migrate`](https://github.com/operator-framework/operator-sdk/blob/v0.4.0/doc/sdk-cli-reference.md#migrate) which adds a main.go source file and any associated source files for an operator that is not of the "go" type. ([#887](https://github.com/operator-framework/operator-sdk/pull/887) and [#897](https://github.com/operator-framework/operator-sdk/pull/897))
- New commands [`operator-sdk run ansible`](https://github.com/operator-framework/operator-sdk/blob/v0.4.0/doc/sdk-cli-reference.md#ansible) and [`operator-sdk run helm`](https://github.com/operator-framework/operator-sdk/blob/v0.4.0/doc/sdk-cli-reference.md#helm) which run the SDK as ansible  and helm operator processes, respectively. These are intended to be used when running in a Pod inside a cluster. Developers wanting to run their operator locally should continue to use `up local`. ([#887](https://github.com/operator-framework/operator-sdk/pull/887) and [#897](https://github.com/operator-framework/operator-sdk/pull/897))
- Ansible operator proxy added the cache handler which allows the get requests to use the operators cache. [#760](https://github.com/operator-framework/operator-sdk/pull/760)
- Ansible operator proxy added ability to dynamically watch dependent resource that were created by ansible operator. [#857](https://github.com/operator-framework/operator-sdk/pull/857)
- Ansible-based operators have leader election turned on by default. When upgrading, add environment variable `POD_NAME` to your operator's Deployment using the Kubernetes downward API. To see an example, run `operator-sdk new --type=ansible ...` and see file `deploy/operator.yaml`.
- A new command [`operator-sdk scorecard`](https://github.com/operator-framework/operator-sdk/blob/v0.4.0/doc/sdk-cli-reference.md#scorecard) which runs a series of generic tests on operators to ensure that an operator follows best practices. For more information, see the [`Scorecard Documentation`](doc/test-framework/scorecard.md)

### Changed

- The official images for the Ansible and Helm operators have moved! Travis now builds, tags, and pushes operator base images during CI ([#832](https://github.com/operator-framework/operator-sdk/pull/832)).
  - [quay.io/operator-framework/ansible-operator](https://quay.io/repository/operator-framework/ansible-operator)
  - [quay.io/operator-framework/helm-operator](https://quay.io/repository/operator-framework/helm-operator)

### Bug Fixes

- Fixes deadlocks during operator deployment rollouts, which were caused by operator pods requiring a leader election lock to become ready ([#932](https://github.com/operator-framework/operator-sdk/pull/932))

## v0.3.0

### Added

- Helm type operator generation support ([#776](https://github.com/operator-framework/operator-sdk/pull/776))

### Changed

- The SDK's Kubernetes Golang dependency versions/revisions have been updated from `v1.11.2` to `v1.12.3`. ([#807](https://github.com/operator-framework/operator-sdk/pull/807))
- The controller-runtime version has been updated from `v0.1.4` to `v0.1.8`. See the `v0.1.8` [release notes](https://github.com/kubernetes-sigs/controller-runtime/releases/tag/v0.1.8) for details.
- The SDK now generates the CRD with the status subresource enabled by default. See the [client doc](https://github.com/operator-framework/operator-sdk/blob/master/doc/user/client.md#updating-status-subresource) on how to update the status subresource. ([#787](https://github.com/operator-framework/operator-sdk/pull/787))

### Deprecated

### Removed

### Bug Fixes

## v0.2.1

### Bug Fixes

- Pin controller-runtime version to v0.1.4 to fix dependency issues and pin ansible idna package to version 2.7 ([#831](https://github.com/operator-framework/operator-sdk/pull/831))

## v0.2.0

### Changed

- The SDK now uses logr as the default logger to unify the logging output with the controller-runtime logs. Users can still use a logger of their own choice. See the [logging doc](https://github.com/operator-framework/operator-sdk/blob/master/doc/user/logging.md) on how the SDK initializes and uses logr.
- Ansible Operator CR status better aligns with [conventions](https://github.com/kubernetes/community/blob/master/contributors/devel/sig-architecture/api-conventions.md#typical-status-properties). ([#639](https://github.com/operator-framework/operator-sdk/pull/639))

### Added

- A new command [`operator-sdk print-deps`](https://github.com/operator-framework/operator-sdk/blob/v0.2.0/doc/sdk-cli-reference.md#print-deps) which prints Golang packages and versions expected by the current Operator SDK version. Supplying `--as-file` prints packages and versions in Gopkg.toml format. ([#772](https://github.com/operator-framework/operator-sdk/pull/772))
- Add [`cluster-scoped`](https://github.com/operator-framework/operator-sdk/blob/master/doc/user-guide.md#operator-scope) flag to `operator-sdk new` command ([#747](https://github.com/operator-framework/operator-sdk/pull/747))
- Add [`up-local`](https://github.com/operator-framework/operator-sdk/blob/v0.2.0/doc/sdk-cli-reference.md#flags-9) flag to `test local` subcommand ([#781](https://github.com/operator-framework/operator-sdk/pull/781))
- Add [`no-setup`](https://github.com/operator-framework/operator-sdk/blob/v0.2.0/doc/sdk-cli-reference.md#flags-9) flag to `test local` subcommand ([#770](https://github.com/operator-framework/operator-sdk/pull/770))
- Add [`image`](https://github.com/operator-framework/operator-sdk/blob/v0.2.0/doc/sdk-cli-reference.md#flags-9) flag to `test local` subcommand ([#768](https://github.com/operator-framework/operator-sdk/pull/768))
- Ansible Operator log output includes much more information for troubleshooting ansible errors. ([#713](https://github.com/operator-framework/operator-sdk/pull/713))
- Ansible Operator periodic reconciliation can be disabled ([#739](https://github.com/operator-framework/operator-sdk/pull/739))

### Bug fixes

- Ansible type operator generation support ([#486](https://github.com/operator-framework/operator-sdk/pull/486), [#559](https://github.com/operator-framework/operator-sdk/pull/559))

### Changed

- Moved the rendering of `deploy/operator.yaml` to the `operator-sdk new` command instead of `operator-sdk build`

## v0.0.6

### Added

- Added `operator-sdk up` command to help deploy an operator. Currently supports running an operator locally against an existing cluster e.g `operator-sdk up local --kubeconfig=<path-to-kubeconfig> --namespace=<operator-namespace>`. See `operator-sdk up -h` for help. [#219](https://github.com/operator-framework/operator-sdk/pull/219) [#274](https://github.com/operator-framework/operator-sdk/pull/274)
- Added initial default metrics to be captured and exposed by Prometheus. [#323](https://github.com/operator-framework/operator-sdk/pull/323) exposes the metrics port and [#349](https://github.com/operator-framework/operator-sdk/pull/323) adds the initial default metrics.
- Added initial test framework for operators [#377](https://github.com/operator-framework/operator-sdk/pull/377), [#392](https://github.com/operator-framework/operator-sdk/pull/392), [#393](https://github.com/operator-framework/operator-sdk/pull/393)

[#242](https://github.com/operator-framework/operator-sdk/pull/242)
- The SDK exposes the Kubernetes clientset via `k8sclient.GetKubeClient()` #295
- The SDK now vendors the k8s code-generators for an operator instead of using the prebuilt image `gcr.io/coreos-k8s-scale-testing/codegen:1.9.3` [#319](https://github.com/operator-framework/operator-sdk/pull/242)
- The SDK exposes the Kubernetes rest config via `k8sclient.GetKubeConfig()` #338
- Use `time.Duration` instead of `int` for `sdk.Watch` [#427](https://github.com/operator-framework/operator-sdk/pull/427)

### Fixed

- The cache of available clients is being reset every minute for discovery of newely added resources to a cluster. [#280](https://github.com/operator-framework/operator-sdk/pull/280)
