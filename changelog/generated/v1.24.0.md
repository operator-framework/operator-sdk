## v1.24.0

### Changes

- Bumping java-operator-plugins to v0.6.0. ([#6007](https://github.com/operator-framework/operator-sdk/pull/6007))

### Bug Fixes

- Support test selectors in scorecard-kuttl. This only works if you supply a test name in the config for the entrypoint in the scorecard test config.yaml
In the `stages.tests`section add an `entrypoint`, in this entrypoint you add the name of the test you want to associate with the selector.
If you have a kuttl test directory called `smoke` your entrypoint should have `- smoke` as an entry. That way scorecard can pass that into the image and kuttl will run the single test. ([#6015](https://github.com/operator-framework/operator-sdk/pull/6015))
- `operator-sdk run bundle(-upgrade)`: fixed bug that made it so bundles weren't properly upgraded if the  channel used in the bundle wasn't in the same channel as the bundle installed via `operator-sdk run bundle`. Using `operator-sdk run bundle` will now use a default channel instead of the one in the bundle. ([#6042](https://github.com/operator-framework/operator-sdk/pull/6042))
- `operator-sdk run bundle(-upgrade)`: fixed bug causing `operator-sdk run bundle-upgrade` and `operator-sdk run bundle ... --index-image=...` to stall indefinitely. ([#6040](https://github.com/operator-framework/operator-sdk/pull/6040))
- For Ansible & Helm-based operators, the generated `Makefile` does not handle converting `aarch64` to `arm64`. This prevents it from downloading the appropriate binaries.
This change simply adds a call to `sed` to convert `aarch64` to `arm64`. ([#5480](https://github.com/operator-framework/operator-sdk/pull/5480))
