## v1.9.0

### Changes

- **Breaking change**: For Ansible operators, if an API endpoint has path component in it then the ansible-operator binary will terminate early with an error, due to a bug in the proxy that would cause the operator to target the wrong cluster. ([#4987](https://github.com/operator-framework/operator-sdk/pull/4987))

### Bug Fixes

- For helm-based operators, empty patch requests generated from the 3-way merge are filtered to avoid unnecessary requests to the kube apiserver. ([#4957](https://github.com/operator-framework/operator-sdk/pull/4957))
