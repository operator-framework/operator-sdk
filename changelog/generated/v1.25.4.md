## v1.25.4

### Changes

- `operator-sdk run bundle(-upgrade)`: Change default of the `--security-context-config` flag to be `legacy` instead of `restricted`. ([#6261](https://github.com/operator-framework/operator-sdk/pull/6261))
- `operator-sdk run bundle`: When creating the CatalogSource, we now set the `grpcPodConfig.SecurityContextConfig` to the value of the  `--security-context-config` flag. ([#6261](https://github.com/operator-framework/operator-sdk/pull/6261))

### Bug Fixes

- `operator-sdk bundle validate`: Fix a bug in the Kubernetes 1.25 validation logic that would warn that a Kubernetes resource was deprecated without checking the group that contains the resource.  (i.e if apps/deployments was deprecated and you used other/deployments you would recieve a warning)". The validation logic will now verify the group and resource before issuing a warning. ([#6263](https://github.com/operator-framework/operator-sdk/pull/6263))
- For `operator-sdk run bundle(-upgrade)`: fix a bug in the logic that would attempt to create a `ConfigMap` that contained the entire contents of an FBC. Now if the FBC contents are to large to fit into a single `ConfigMap`, the FBC contents will be partitioned and split amongst multiple `ConfigMap` resources. ([#6262](https://github.com/operator-framework/operator-sdk/pull/6262))
- `operator-sdk run bundle(-upgrade)`: Fix a bug where SQLite bundle images were failing to be run properly due to a change in the default channel that is used by `run bundle(-upgrade)` when creating a subscription. ([#6261](https://github.com/operator-framework/operator-sdk/pull/6261))
- `operator-sdk run bundle(-upgrade)`: Update the logic used to set a Registry Pod's PSA configuration to fix a bug where a Pod's containers still had a restrictive SecurityContext even when setting `--security-context-config=legacy`. ([#6261](https://github.com/operator-framework/operator-sdk/pull/6261))
- (scorecard): Fixes a bug where an error would be thrown if a Custom Resource did not have a `.spec` field, which is a perfectly valid scenario.  Instead of throwing an error scorecard will now issue a suggestion. ([#6266](https://github.com/operator-framework/operator-sdk/pull/6266))
