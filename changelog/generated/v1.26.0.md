## v1.26.0

### Additions

- For `operator-sdk bundle validate`: When checking for Kubernetes APIs deprecated in Kubernetes v1.25.0 the ClusterServiceVersion's CustomResourceDefinitions,  ClusterPermissions, and Permissions are now validated to ensure no references to  deprecated APIs are being made. ([#6119](https://github.com/operator-framework/operator-sdk/pull/6119))

### Changes

- (images): Bumps all Operator SDK maintained images to now use ubi(-minimal) tag 8.7. ([#6175](https://github.com/operator-framework/operator-sdk/pull/6175))

### Bug Fixes

- ansible: fixed "make run" so it finds local roles. ([#6110](https://github.com/operator-framework/operator-sdk/pull/6110))
- For `operator-sdk run bundle(-upgrade)`: fix a bug in the logic that would attempt to create a `ConfigMap` that contained the entire contents of an FBC. Now if the FBC contents are to large to fit into a single `ConfigMap`, the FBC contents will be partitioned and split amongst multiple `ConfigMap` resources. ([#6182](https://github.com/operator-framework/operator-sdk/pull/6182))
