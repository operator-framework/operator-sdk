## v1.19.1

### Bug Fixes

- The related image discovery feature currently only reads environment variables from the manager container. This was causing an error when the deployment labels or container name that was expected were not present. This fixes that by collecting related images from all containers across all deployments.
This change also enables users to use related images in other containers since related images from everywhere will be considered. ([#5656](https://github.com/operator-framework/operator-sdk/pull/5656))
