## v1.32.0

### Additions

- For Helm-based operators, whenever the operator encounters an  error during reconcilliation, it would attempt to rollback the changes with the `--force` option. This behavior could have  undesired side effects in some scenario.
This change allows the users to change this behavior by adding the  annotation, `helm.sdk.operatorframework.io/rollback-force: false`
 to the custom resource. ([#6546](https://github.com/operator-framework/operator-sdk/pull/6546))

### Bug Fixes

- (helm): Use informer cache label selectors to reduce memory consumption. ([#6377](https://github.com/operator-framework/operator-sdk/pull/6377))
- (helm): Fix bug with detection of owner reference support when setting up dynamic watches. ([#6377](https://github.com/operator-framework/operator-sdk/pull/6377))
