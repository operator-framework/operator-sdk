## v1.22.1

### Bug Fixes

- For Hybrid Helm (hybrid.helm/v1-alpha) language based operators: Bump Dockerfile Go version to 1.18. ([#5772](https://github.com/operator-framework/operator-sdk/pull/5772))
- For `operator-sdk run bundle-upgrade`: fix a bug that caused `InstallPlan`s occasionally not being approved when attempting to upgrade a bundle. ([#5924](https://github.com/operator-framework/operator-sdk/pull/5924))
- For run bundle-upgrade, generate just the extra FBC of the bundle instead of rendering the entire index and appending bundle contents to it. ([#5917](https://github.com/operator-framework/operator-sdk/pull/5917))
