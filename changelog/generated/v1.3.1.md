## v1.3.1

### Bug Fixes

- Project version now determines how package name is retrieved for a project. ([#4443](https://github.com/operator-framework/operator-sdk/pull/4443))
- `run bundle-upgrade` now handles error gracefully when a previous operator version doesn't exist. ([#4451](https://github.com/operator-framework/operator-sdk/pull/4451))
- For Go-based projects, `generate <bundle|packagemanifests>` subcommands now consider package and type names when parsing Go API types files to generate a CSV's `owned.customresourcedefinitions`, such that types in different packages and files will not overwrite each other. ([#4480](https://github.com/operator-framework/operator-sdk/pull/4480))
- Bumped operator-framework/api to prevent `operator-sdk bundle validate` from exiting non-0 when validation emits only warnings. ([#4458](https://github.com/operator-framework/operator-sdk/pull/4458))
- Fixed panic when "operator-sdk bundle validate" fails. ([#4386](https://github.com/operator-framework/operator-sdk/pull/4386))
- Fixed invalid object names generated for long package names passed to `run packagemanifests` & `run bundle`. ([#4476](https://github.com/operator-framework/operator-sdk/pull/4476))
- Corrected the download URL for helm-operator and ansible-operator in their respective project types. ([#4412](https://github.com/operator-framework/operator-sdk/pull/4412))
- Fixed the order of helm-operator, ansible-operator, and kustomize binary checks in the Makefile. ([#4412](https://github.com/operator-framework/operator-sdk/pull/4412))
- Fixed a bug that caused the Helm operator to remove the finalizer without doing a helm uninstall. ([#4457](https://github.com/operator-framework/operator-sdk/pull/4457))
