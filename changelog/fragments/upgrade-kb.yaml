        with `sigs.k8s.io/controller-runtime v0.6.3` and then run `go mod tidy`.

      For Golang based operators with multigroup support, fix scaffolded `controllers/<group>/suite_test.go` to have
            a correct `envtest.Environment.CRDDirectoryPaths` ([kubebuilder#1665](https://github.com/kubernetes-sigs/kubebuilder/pull/1665)).

    migration:
      header: (Golang based operators with multigroup support) Fix `CRDDirectoryPath` in `controllers/<group>/suite_test.go`
      body: >
        If your project is multi-group, then replace
        `CRDDirectoryPaths: []string{filepath.Join("..", "config", "crd", "bases")},` with
        `CRDDirectoryPaths: []string{filepath.Join("..", "..", "config", "crd", "bases")},`
        in `suite_test.go` files found in `controllers/<group>/` directories. Otherwise, the tests will fail since
        this EnvTest will not be looking for the CRD's in the correct location. For more info, see
        [kubebuilder#1665](https://github.com/kubernetes-sigs/kubebuilder/issues/1665).
