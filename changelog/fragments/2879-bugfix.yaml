      bundle create: print deprecation notice for old bundle format, and adopt
      behavior more akin to 'opm' so existing bundles are not overwritten in
      situations like those described by [#2879](https://github.com/operator-framework/operator-sdk/issues/2879).

    kind: "bugfix"

    breaking: false
