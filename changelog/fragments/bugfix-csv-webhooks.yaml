      (manifests/v2) Added a `config/manifests` kustomize patch to remove the cert-manager
      volume and volumeMount from manifests destined for `generate <bundle|packagemanifests>`
    kind: bugfix
    migration:
      header: (manifests/v2) Add a kustomize patch to remove the cert-manager volume/volumeMount from your CSV
      body: >
        OLM does [not yet support cert-manager](https://olm.operatorframework.io/docs/advanced-tasks/adding-admission-and-conversion-webhooks/#certificate-authority-requirements),
        so a JSON patch was added to remove this volume and mount such that
        OLM can itself create and manage certs for your Operator.

        In `config/manifests/kustomization.yaml`, add the following:

        ```yaml
        patchesJson6902:
        - target:
            group: apps
            version: v1
            kind: Deployment
            name: controller-manager
            namespace: system
          patch: |-
            # Remove the manager container's "cert" volumeMount, since OLM will create and mount a set of certs.
            # Update the indices in this path if adding or removing containers/volumeMounts in the manager's Deployment.
            - op: remove
              path: /spec/template/spec/containers/1/volumeMounts/0
            # Remove the "cert" volume, since OLM will create and mount a set of certs.
            # Update the indices in this path if adding or removing volumes in the manager's Deployment.
            - op: remove
              path: /spec/template/spec/volumes/0
        ```
