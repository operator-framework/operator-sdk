  - description: Updated Kubernetes dependencies to v1.18.2
    kind: "change"
    breaking: true
    migration:
      header: Kubernetes client-go contexts
      body: |-
        Operators using client-go directly and operators
        that have generated clientsets will be required to
        update many of their client-go function calls, which
        have signature changes related to passing contexts
        and options.

        Users can use http://sigs.k8s.io/clientgofix to 
        rewrite method invocations to the new signatures.

  - description: Updated controller-runtime to v0.6.0
    kind: "change"

      body: |-
        There were various breaking changes in controller-runtime
        v0.6.0.

          - Informers methods now require a context parameter
          - Owns, For, and Watches funtions now take variadic
            functional option arguments.

  - description: Updated controller-tools to v0.3.0
    kind: "change"

  - description: Updated helm to v3.2.0
    kind: "change"
   
  - description: Removed automatic migration of helm releases from v2 to v3
    kind: "removal"
    breaking: true
    migration:
      header: Helm operator no longer migrates v2 releases to v3
      body: |-
        The deprecated support for Helm v2 releases has been removed. If
        you require automigration of Helm v2 releases, continue using
        v0.17.x.

        This removal does NOT affect support for v2 Helm charts, which
        are still supported by Helm v3.

  - description: Removed support for deprecated helm release naming scheme
    kind: "removal"
    breaking: true
    migration:
      header: >
        Helm operator no longer supports deprecated UID-based release names
      body: |-
        In v0.11.0, the Helm operator began using the CR name as the release
        name while also maintaining backwards compatibility for legacy
        UID-based release names. Continued support for the UID-based release
        names has been removed.

        Before upgrading to this release, delete and recreate custom resources
        that are still using the deprecated UID-based release name. To determine
        if you have any UID-based release names still in use, inspect the
        `status.deployedRelease` field of your custom resources and look for
        release names that end with a 25-character random string.
