      header: Updated Go version
      body: >
        All Operator SDK components now use Go 1.25.0. Any projects created or
        maintained using this version of the SDK should update their Go version
        to 1.25.0 for compatibility. Update your go.mod file to use `go 1.25.0`
        and update all Dockerfiles to use the golang:1.25 base image for builds.
