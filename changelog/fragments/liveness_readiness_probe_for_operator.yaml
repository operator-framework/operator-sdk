      For Helm-based operators, added Liveness and Readiness probe by default using [`healthz.Ping`](https://pkg.go.dev/sigs.k8s.io/controller-runtime/pkg/healthz#CheckHandler).

      header: (Optional) For Helm-based operators, add Liveness and Readiness probe
      body: >
        New projects built with the tool will have the probes configured by default. The endpoints `/healthz` and
        `/readyz` are available now in the image based provided.

        You can update your pre-existing project to use them. For that update the Dockerfile to use the latest
        release base image, then add the following to the `manager` container in
        `config/default/manager/manager.yaml`:

        ```yaml
          livenessProbe:
            httpGet:
              path: /healthz
              port: 8081
            initialDelaySeconds: 15
            periodSeconds: 20
          readinessProbe:
            httpGet:
              path: /readyz
              port: 8081
            initialDelaySeconds: 5
            periodSeconds: 10
