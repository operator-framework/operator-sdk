      (go/v2, go/v3, ansible/v1, helm/v1) Added the `opm` and `catalog-build` Makefile targets to
      download [`opm`](https://github.com/operator-framework/operator-registry/blob/v1.15.1/docs/design/opm-tooling.md)
      and build operator catalogs either from scratch or an existing catalog.

      header: (go/v2, go/v3, ansible/v1, helm/v1) Add `opm` and `catalog-build` Makefile targets
      body: >
        The `opm` and `catalog-build` Makefile targets were added so operator developers who
        want to create their own catalogs for their operator or add their operator's bundle(s) to an
        existing catalog can do so. If this sounds like you, add the following lines to the bottom
        of your Makefile:

        ```make
        .PHONY: opm
        OPM = ./bin/opm
        opm:
        ifeq (,$(wildcard $(OPM)))
        ifeq (,$(shell which opm 2>/dev/null))
        	@{ \
        	set -e ;\
        	mkdir -p $(dir $(OPM)) ;\
        	curl -sSLo $(OPM) https://github.com/operator-framework/operator-registry/releases/download/v1.15.1/$(OS)-$(ARCH)-opm ;\
        	chmod +x $(OPM) ;\
        	}
        else
        OPM = $(shell which opm)
        endif
        endif

        BUNDLE_IMGS ?= $(BUNDLE_IMG)
        CATALOG_IMG ?= $(IMAGE_TAG_BASE)-catalog:v$(VERSION)
        ifneq ($(origin CATALOG_BASE_IMG), undefined)
        FROM_INDEX_OPT := --from-index $(CATALOG_BASE_IMG)
        endif
        .PHONY: catalog-build
        catalog-build: opm
        	$(OPM) index add --mode semver --tag $(CATALOG_IMG) --bundles $(BUNDLE_IMGS) $(FROM_INDEX_OPT)

        # Push the catalog image.
        .PHONY: catalog-push
        catalog-push:
        	$(MAKE) docker-push IMG=$(CATALOG_IMG)
        ```

        If updating a Go operator project, additionally add the following Makefile variables:

        ```make
        OS = $(shell go env GOOS)
        ARCH = $(shell go env GOARCH)
        ```

      (go/v2, go/v3, ansible/v1, helm/v1) Changed `BUNDLE_IMG` and added `IMAGE_TAG_BASE` Makefile variables
      to allow one line bundle and catalog image builds.
    kind: change

      header: (go/v2, go/v3, ansible/v1, helm/v1) Changed `BUNDLE_IMG` and added `IMAGE_TAG_BASE` Makefile variables
      body: >
        The following Makefile changes were made to allow `make bundle-build bundle-push catalog-build catalog-push`
        and encode image repo/namespace information in the Makefile by default:

        ```diff
        +IMAGE_TAG_BASE ?= <registry>/<operator name>
        +
        -BUNDLE_IMG ?= controller-bundle:$(VERSION)
        +BUNDLE_IMG ?= $(IMAGE_TAG_BASE)-bundle:v$(VERSION)
        ```

        For example, if `IMAGE_TAG_BASE ?= foo/bar-operator` then running `make bundle-build bundle-push catalog-build catalog-push`
        would build `foo/bar-operator-bundle:v0.0.1` and `foo/bar-operator-catalog:v0.0.1` then push them to the
        `docker.io/foo` namespaced registry.
