# entries is a list of entries to include in
# release notes and/or the migration guide
entries:
  - description: >
      Description is the line that shows up in the CHANGELOG. This
      should be formatted as markdown and be on a single line. Using
      the YAML string '>' operator means you can write your entry
      multiple lines and it will still be parsed as a single line.

      If an operator type's plugin is being changed then prefix the description with
      "(<operator language>/<plugin version>)", ex. "(go/v2)".
      If an operator type's runtime is being changed, use then prefix the description
      with "For <operator language>-based operators,", ex. "For Go-based operators".
