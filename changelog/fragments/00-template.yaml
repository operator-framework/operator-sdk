# entries is a list of entries to include in
# release notes and/or the migration guide
entries:
  - description: >
      Description is the line that shows up in the CHANGELOG. This
      should be formatted as markdown and be on a single line. Using
      the YAML string '>' operator means you can write your entry
      multiple lines and it will still be parsed as a single line.

      If an operator type's plugin is being changed then prefix the description with
      "(<operator language>/<plugin version>)", ex. "(go/v2)".
      If an operator type's runtime is being changed, use then prefix the description
      with "For <operator language>-based operators,", ex. "For Go-based operators".

    # Migration can be defined to automatically add a section to
    # the migration guide. This is required for breaking changes.
    migration:
      header: Header text for the migration section
      body: |
        Body of the migration section. This should be formatted as markdown and can
        span multiple lines.

        Using the YAML string '|' operator means that newlines in this string will
        be honored and interpretted as newlines in the rendered markdown.
