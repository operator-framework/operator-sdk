      header: Migrate your project to use the plugin v3/go-alpha
      body: >
        `v3+` plugins are still in alpha phase and are not scaffolded by default.
        You are able to use them, try it out and get all improvements made so far by initializing projects with
        the arg `--plugins=go/v3-alpha`:

        ```sh
        operator-sdk init --domain my.domain --plugins=go.kubebuilder.io/v3-alpha
        ```

        Currently, the plugin `v3-alpha` has NO breaking changes. However, until it
        is declared stable breaking changes can be made. Following the steps for you
        migrate your pre-existent project to use the go/v3-alpha plugin.

        1. Update your PROJECT file

        Update the `layout` setting to the new plugin version `go.sdk.operatorframework.io/v3-alpha` as follows:

        ```sh
          $ cat PROJECT
        domain: example.com
        layout: go.kubebuilder.io/v3-alpha
        projectName: memcached-operator
        repo: github.com/example/memcached-operator
        resources:
        - group: cache
          kind: Memcached
          version: v1alpha1
        version: 3-alpha
        plugins:
          go.sdk.operatorframework.io/v3-alpha: {}
        ```
