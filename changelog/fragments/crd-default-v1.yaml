      header: Default CRD version
      body: |-
        The default CRD version was changed from `apiextensions.k8s.io/v1beta1`
        to `apiextensions.k8s.io/v1` for commands that create or generate
        CRDs. To migrate CRDs from `v1beta1` to `v1`, simply re-run
        `operator-sdk generate crds`. To continue generating CRDs with
        `apiextensions.k8s.io/v1beta1`, use `--crd-version=v1beta1`.

        The following CRD versions are (or will be) compatible with the
        following Kubernetes versions:

          - Kubernetes <= v1.15 - Only `apiextensions.k8s.io/v1beta1` supported
          - Kubernetes v1.16 through v1.18 - Both `apiextensions.k8s.io/v1beta1`
            and `apiextensions.k8s.io/v1` supported
          - Kubernetes >= v1.19 - Only `apiextensions.k8s.io/v1` supported
