      Fix a bug where `olm install` command is failed fo "no-match" error.
      
      The output in this case is something like:
      
      ```
      $ operator-sdk olm install --verbose
      ...
      FATA[0001] Failed to install OLM version "latest": failed to create CRDs and resources: no matches for kind "OLMConfig" in version "operators.coreos.com/v1" 
      ```
        
      Now, in this case, operator-sdk tries to create the resource again, until it succeed (or until the timeout exceeded).

    kind: "bugfix"

    # Is this a breaking change?
    breaking: false
