      header: (Optional) Add livenessProbe check for Ansible-based operators
      body: >
        Existing operators will have a healthz endpoint without intervention,
        but to take advantage of it, a liveness probe should be manually added
        to the operator manifest. For example, the `deploy/operator.yaml` file would need to include:

        ```yaml
          livenessProbe:
            httpGet:
              path: /healthz
              port: 6789
            initialDelaySeconds: 5
            periodSeconds: 3
        ```
