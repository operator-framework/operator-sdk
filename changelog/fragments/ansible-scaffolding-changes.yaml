      (ansible/v1) Modified ansible scaffolding in order to incorporate 
      changes with Kubebuilder on `--component-config` flag changes. 
      Previously, the changes with `--component-config` flag were not 
      considered by default.

      The following are the modifications:
      1. If the `--component-config` flag is passed then look for `- /manager` 
      in `manager.yaml` in order to add leader election id. If the component 
      config flag is not passed then check for `--leader-elect` flag.
      2. In `manager_proxy_patch.yaml` file, look for `memory: 64Mi` 
      if the component flag is passed flag is passed. If not then look 
      for `--leader-elect`.
      3. Repeat the same logic for replacing the port number from the file.
      4. At the end, update the `manager.yaml` file to avoid lint errors.
