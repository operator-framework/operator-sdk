    migration:
      header: Remove the file `/bin/ao-logs` for Ansible based-operators
      body: >
        The `inotify-tools` as a dependency of Ansible based-operator images which was deprecated
        in the version `v0.16.0` was removed. This dependency was used to output the Ansible logs
        in a side-car container called `ansible`, which has no longer been scaffolded by default.
        In this way, if you have any customization using this dependency be aware that it is no longer
        in the Ansible based-operator image and then, feel free to remove this file `/bin/ao-logs`
        for your projects since it has no longer usage.
        For further information also see the section `Remove Ansible container sidecar` on the migration
        guide of the version `v0.16.0`.
