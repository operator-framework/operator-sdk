      (go/v2) Changed `go` PROJECT plugin object to `manifests` and `scorecard` objects (`.sdk.operatorframework.io` suffix)
    kind: change
    breaking: false
    migration:
      header: (go/v2) Change `go` PROJECT plugin object to `manifests` and `scorecard` objects
      body: >
        The `manifests` and `scorecard` plugins that create OLM and scorecard manifests, respectively,
        now have plugin objects that direct `create` subcommands to create related files.
        While the old `go` plugin configuration object is still supported, these new objects will be useful
        in the future as configuration options are added to their respective plugins:

        Old:
        ```yaml
        version: 3-alpha
        ...
        plugins:
          go.sdk.operatorframework.io/v2-alpha: {}
        ```

        New:
        ```yaml
        version: 3-alpha
        ...
        plugins:
          manifests.sdk.operatorframework.io/v2: {}
          scorecard.sdk.operatorframework.io/v2: {}
        ```

      (ansible/v1, helm/v1) Added plugin objects for the `manifests` and `scorecard` phase 2 plugins
    kind: addition
    migration:
      header: (ansible/v1, helm/v1) Add `manifests` and `scorecard` plugin objects to your PROJECT
      body: >
        The `manifests` and `scorecard` plugins that create OLM and scorecard manifests, respectively,
        now have plugin objects that direct `create` subcommands to create related files. While not necessary
        to add, these new plugin configuration objects in the PROJECT file will be useful in the future
        as configuration options are added to their respective plugins:

        ```yaml
        version: 3-alpha
        ...
        plugins:

          scorecard.sdk.operatorframework.io/v2: {}
        ```
