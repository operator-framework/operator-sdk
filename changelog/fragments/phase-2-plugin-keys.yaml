      (ansible/v1, helm/v1, go/v2) Added plugin keys for the `manifests` and `scorecard` phase 2 plugins
    kind: addition
    breaking: false
    migration:
      header: Add `manifests` and `scorecard` plugin keys to your PROJECT
      body: >
        The `manifests` and `scorecard` plugins that create OLM and scorecard manifests, respectively,
        now have plugin keys that direct `create` subcommands to create related files. While not necessary
        to add, the following plugin configuration objects in the PROJECT file will be useful in the future
        as configuration options are added to their respective plugins:

        ```yaml
        version: 3-alpha
        ...
        plugins:
          manifests.sdk.operatorframework.io/v2: {}
          scorecard.sdk.operatorframework.io/v2: {}
        ```

        For Go projects, you can replace `go.sdk.operatorframework.io/v2-alpha: {}` line with the above two keys.
