      PROJECT config version 3-alpha has been upgraded to version 3

      header: PROJECT config version 3-alpha must be upgraded to 3
      body: >
        PROJECT config version 3-alpha has been stabilized as
        [version 3](https://github.com/kubernetes-sigs/kubebuilder/blob/master/docs/book/src/migration/manually_migration_guide_v2_v3.md)
        (the `version` key in your PROJECT file), and contains a set of config fields sufficient
        to fully describe a project. While this change is not technically breaking
        because the spec at that version was alpha, it was used by default in `operator-sdk` commands
        so should be marked as breaking and have a convenient migration path.
        The `alpha config-3alpha-to-3` command will convert most of your PROJECT file
        from version 3-alpha to 3, and leave comments with directions where
        automatic conversion is not possible:

        ```console
        $ cat PROJECT
        version: 3-alpha
        resources:
        - crdVersion: v1
        ...
        $ operator-sdk alpha config-3alpha-to-3
        Your PROJECT config file has been converted from version 3-alpha to 3. Please make sure all config data is correct.
        $ cat PROJECT
        version: "3"
        resources:
        - api:
            crdVersion: v1
        ...
        ```
