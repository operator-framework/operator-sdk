      Changed the suggested finalizer format to `<qualified-group>/<finalizer-name>`

      header: Change your operator's finalizer names
      body: >
        The finalizer name format suggested by [Kubernetes docs](https://kubernetes.io/docs/tasks/extend-kubernetes/custom-resources/custom-resource-definitions/#finalizers)
        is `<qualified-group>/<finalizer-name>`, while the format previously documented by Operator SDK docs was
        `<finalizer-name>.<qualified-group>`. If your operator uses any finalizers with names matching the incorrect format,
        change them to match the official format.
        For example, `finalizer.cache.example.com` should be changed to `cache.example.com/finalizer`.
