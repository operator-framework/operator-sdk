      An additional condition is included for matching `apiVersion` of example CRs with CRD `version` when searching for the CRD in the CSV. 
      Previously, The `olm-spec-descriptors` scorecard test failed when multiple versions of CRD is included in the CSV. 
      The CR specified in `alm-examples` annotations are validated only against the first matched CRD (by name), which is incorrect. 
      This ensures the correct CRD version is selected for validations.
