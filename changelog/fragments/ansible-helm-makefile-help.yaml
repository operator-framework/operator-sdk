      header: (helm/v1, ansible/v1) Add `help` target to Makefile.
      body: >
        Ansible/Helm projects now provide a Makefile `help` target, similar to a `--help` flag.
        You can copy and paste this target from the relevant sample's Makefile
        ([helm]((https://github.com/operator-framework/operator-sdk/blob/v1.5.0/testdata/helm/memcached-operator/Makefile), [ansible]((https://github.com/operator-framework/operator-sdk/blob/v1.5.0/testdata/ansible/memcached-operator/Makefile)).
