      For Go-based projects, `generate <bundle|packagemanifests>` subcommands now consider package and type names
      when parsing Go API types files to generate a CSV's `owned.customresourcedefinitions`, such that types in
      different packages and files will not overwrite each other.
    kind: bugfix
