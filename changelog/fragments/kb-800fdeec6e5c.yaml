      For Golang-based language (go/v2), fix issue introduced by removing the GO111MODULE=on from Dockerfile. ([More info](https://github.com/kubernetes-sigs/kubebuilder/pull/2678))

      **IMPORTANT NOTE**: If you are using `go/v2` we highly recommend to upgrade your project to latest `go/v3` plugin (default operator-sdk scaffold). Please be aware that
      `go/v2` is a plugin which was kept to ensure the backwards compatibility with old Kubebuilder
      layout produced using its CLI versions < `3.0.0`. ([More info](https://book.kubebuilder.io/plugins/go-v2-plugin.html))
      Therefore, we are unable to upgrade this plugin continuously and solve tech-debts as it is
      very likely that it would soon be deprecated by the Kubebuilder community. Note that projects built
      with this plugin do not produce CRDs for example using v1 APIs so that cannot work on
      Kubernetes cluster >= `1.22`). Please, ensure that you follow our migration guide
      [Migrating from pre-v1.0.0 to latest](https://sdk.operatorframework.io/docs/building-operators/golang/migration/)
