      For Ansible operators, if an API endpoint has path component in it then the ansible-operator binary will terminate early with an error, due to a bug in the proxy that would cause the operator to target the wrong cluster. If there "/" slash at the end of Server path then still it is throwing error which is wrong.
    kind: bugfix
    breaking: false
