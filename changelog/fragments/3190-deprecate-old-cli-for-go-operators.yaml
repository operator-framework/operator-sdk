      With the introduction of the new [Kubebuilder aligned CLI](https://sdk.operatorframework.io/docs/new-cli) 
      and project layout for Go operators, the [old CLI](https://sdk.operatorframework.io/docs/cli) 
      will still continue to work for Go projects scaffolded in the old layout with `operator-sdk new`.
      However the old CLI is now deprecated and will be removed in a future release.
