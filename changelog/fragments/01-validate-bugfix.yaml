      `operator-sdk bundle validate`: Fix a bug in the Kubernetes 1.25 validation logic that would warn that a
      Kubernetes resource was deprecated without checking the group that contains the resource. 
      (i.e if apps/deployments was deprecated and you used other/deployments you would recieve a warning)".
      The validation logic will now verify the group and resource before issuing a warning.

    # kind is one of:
    # - addition
    # - change
    # - deprecation
    # - removal
    # - bugfix
    kind: "bugfix"
