      For Ansible operators, if an API endpoint has path component in it then the ansible-operator binary will terminate early with an error, due to a bug in the proxy that would cause the operator to target the wrong cluster.
    kind: change
    breaking: true
    migration:
      header: The ansible-operator binary will reject the kubeconfig if the server URL contains a path.
      body: >
        There is currently no workaround other than running the operator as a pod in the cluster (where it will use the internal endpoint). The fix for this issue is currently blocked waiting on a fix to the apimachinery package. Once the upstream issue is merged then a proper fix will be done for ansible-operator. Work on this issue is being tracked here: https://github.com/operator-framework/operator-sdk/issues/4925
