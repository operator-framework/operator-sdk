      header: For Helm-based operators delete resource, the finalizer will not be removed until the Helm uninstall is completed without error.
      body: >
        In the prior releases, Helm-based operators delete resource will remove it's finalizer even if the Helm uninstallation completed with error.
        With this change, Helm-based operators will keep attempting to perform Helm uninstall until it completes without error.
        Only then, will the finalizer be removed.
