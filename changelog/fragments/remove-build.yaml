    migration:
      header: Remove `operator-sdk build` references from project
      body: >
        `operator-sdk build` was removed in favor of `make docker-build`. Any image build args passed
        to the removed command can be directly added to the `docker-build` Makefile rule.
        Any Go build args passed to the removed command can be directly added to the project's Dockerfile.
        The image builder can be substituted for `docker` in the `docker-build` Makefile rule, assuming
        flags are the same.
