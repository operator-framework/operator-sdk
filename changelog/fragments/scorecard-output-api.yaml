      Changed scorecard text and json output to use a `v1alpha3.TestList`
      instead of aggregating all test results under a single
      `v1alpha3.Test` and set exit status to 1 when a test fails.
    kind: "change"
    breaking: true
    migration:

      body: |
        Update any scripts interpretting the scorecard output to
        understand the v1alpha3 TestList format.
