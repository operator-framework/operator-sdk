      Go CLI plugin go/v3 is now the default.
    kind: change
    breaking: false
    migration:
      header: Upgrade your Go project from "go.kubebuilder.io/v2" to "go.kubebuilder.io/v3"
      body: >
        The newly released go/v3 plugin has many new features and (breaking) changes
        incompatible with projects created by go/v2. You are not required to upgrade
        and your go/v2 project will continue to work with new operator-sdk versions.
        If you wish to upgrade, check out the upstream
        [migration guide](https://master.book.kubebuilder.io/migration/plugin/plugins.html).

        Additionally, if using project version "3-alpha", you must update your "plugins" config field:

        Old:
        ```yaml
        plugins:
          go.sdk.operatorframework.io/v2-alpha: {}
        ```

        New:
        ```yaml
        plugins:
          manifests.sdk.operatorframework.io/v2: {}
          scorecard.sdk.operatorframework.io/v2: {}
        ```
