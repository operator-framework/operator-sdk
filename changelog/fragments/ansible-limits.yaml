        Add into the config/manager/manager.yaml` the following limits scaffold by default:

        ```yaml
        ...
        # TODO(user): Configure the resources accordingly based on the project requirements.
        # More info: https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/configuration/manage-resources-containers/
        resources:
          limits:
            cpu: 500m
            memory: 768Mi
          requests:
            cpu: 10m
            memory: 256Mi
        ...
        ```

        **IMPORTANT:** These values should be optimize accordingly to the project requirements. The default
        values scaffold are only added to help out Operator Authors getting started and have this configuration
        in place.
