      (go/v2, go/v3, ansible/v1, helm/v1) Fixed the Prometheus `ServiceMonitor` metrics endpoint,
      which was not configured to be scraped correctly.
    kind: bugfix
    migration:
      header: (go/v2, go/v3, ansible/v1, helm/v1) Add scheme, token, and TLS config to the Prometheus `ServiceMonitor` metrics endpoint.
      body: >
        The `/metrics` endpoint, while specifying the `https` port on the manager Pod, was not actually configured
        to serve over https because no tlsConfig was set. Since kube-rbac-proxy secures this endpoint as a
        manager sidecar, using the service account token mounted into the Pod by default corrects this problem.

        The changes should look like:

        ```diff
        # config/prometheus/monitor.yaml

        spec:
           endpoints:
             - path: /metrics
               port: https
        +      scheme: https
        +      bearerTokenFile: /var/run/secrets/kubernetes.io/serviceaccount/token
        +      tlsConfig:
        +        insecureSkipVerify: true
           selector:
             matchLabels:
               control-plane: controller-manager
        ```

        **Note:** if you have removed kube-rbac-proxy from your project, make sure to secure the `/metrics`
        endpoint using a proper [TLS configuration](https://prometheus.io/docs/guides/tls-encryption/).
