      header: Upgrade K8s versions to use 1.26
      body: >
        Regarding the upcoming major changes in the plugin, please note that `go/v3` is being deprecated by Kubebuilder hence Operator SDK would also be migrating to `go/v4` soon.
        Following are the changes to be addressed in your project structure, `Makefile` and `go.mod` files:
        1) [go/v3, ansible/v1, helm/v1] Update your `go.mod` file to upgrade the dependencies and run `go mod tidy` to download them
        ```go
        k8s.io/api v0.26.2
        k8s.io/apiextensions-apiserver v0.26.2
        k8s.io/apimachinery v0.26.2
        k8s.io/cli-runtime v0.26.2
        k8s.io/client-go v0.26.2
        k8s.io/kubectl v0.26.2
        sigs.k8s.io/controller-runtime v0.14.5
        sigs.k8s.io/controller-tools v0.11.3
        sigs.k8s.io/kubebuilder/v3 v3.9.1
        ```
        2) [go/v3, ansible/v1, helm/v1] With the bump to Kubebuilder 3.9.1, the `go/v3` projects are now scaffolded with 0.13.1 version of kube-rbac-proxy. Modify the version of kube-rbac-proxy in the following scaffolded files:
        - config/default/manager_auth_proxy_patch.yaml
        - bundle/manifests/memcached-operator.clusterserviceversion.yaml        

          ```diff
            - gcr.io/kubebuilder/kube-rbac-proxy:v0.13.0
            + gcr.io/kubebuilder/kube-rbac-proxy:v0.13.1
          ```
        3) [gov4alpha] For scaffolds, replace scaffoldings of v1beta1 by using `k8s.io/api/admission/v1` instead of `k8s.io/api/admission/v1beta1` as v1beta1 is removed in latest k8s.
          ```diff
            - admissionv1beta1 "k8s.io/api/admission/v1beta1"
            + admissionv1 "k8s.io/api/admission/v1"
          ```
        4) [gov4alpha] The project structure has changed from `/controllers` to `internal/controller/`. Modify the Dockerfile of the `go/v4-alpha` plugin to below:
          ```diff
            - COPY controllers/ controllers/
            + COPY internal/controller/ internal/controller/
          ```
        5) [go/v3, gov4alpha] Update your Makefile by
          - Replacing `ENVTEST_K8S_VERSION = 1.25` with `ENVTEST_K8S_VERSION = 1.26`.
          - Using `manifests generate fmt vet` to build manager binary by replacing `generate fmt vet` in the build target to `manifests generate fmt vet`:
          ```diff
            - build: generate fmt vet ## Build manager binary.
            + build: manifests generate fmt vet ## Build manager binary.
          ```
        6) [gov4alpha] The gov4alpha plugin is now being scaffolded with Kubebuilder's go/v4-alpha which has a modified project file structure according to Go's best practices. Refer https://github.com/kubernetes-sigs/kubebuilder/pull/2985 for changes. Make the following changes in your scaffolded project if gov4aplha plugin was used:          - Replacing `go run ./main.go` to `go run ./cmd/main.go` due to the change in project structure.
           - Replacing 
          ```diff 
            - `test -s $(LOCALBIN)/controller-gen || GOBIN=$(LOCALBIN) go install sigs.k8s.io/controller-tools/cmd/controller-gen@$(CONTROLLER_TOOLS_VERSION)`
            + test -s $(LOCALBIN)/controller-gen && $(LOCALBIN)/controller-gen --version | grep -q $(CONTROLLER_TOOLS_VERSION) || \
            GOBIN=$(LOCALBIN) go install sigs.k8s.io/controller-tools/cmd/controller-gen@$(CONTROLLER_TOOLS_VERSION)
          ```
