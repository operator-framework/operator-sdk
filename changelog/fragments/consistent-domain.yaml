      header: Update references to legacy operator-sdk domain strings
      body: |
        Update various usages of domains in plugin keys and annotations:

          * In Kubebuilder-style projects, change the `.operator-sdk.io` suffix to `.sdk.operatorframework.io` in the `PROJECT` file.

          * In Ansible and Helm projects, change legacy annotation keys to new annotation keys in sample CR files in your repository.

          * In live clusters containing CRs for Ansible and Helm-based operators:
            1. Patch all existing CRs that use a legacy annotation to ADD the new equivalent annotations alongside the legacy annotations.
            2. Upgrade the operator
            3. Patch all existing CRs that used a legacy annotation to REMOVE the legacy annotations.
