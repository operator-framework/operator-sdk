      For Golang-based projects, add flag ignore-not-found into Makefile for the targets `uninstall` and `undeploy`. With this change,
      you can run `make undeploy ignore-not-found=true`. This way, if you have any errors in your Kustomize
      your make undeploy or make uninstall won't error out when it stumbles on the missing resource.

    breaking: false
    migration:
      header: For Golang-based projects, add the flag `ignore-not-found` into the Makefile for the `uninstall` and `undeploy` targets
      body: >
        Update the Makefile with the following changes.
        1) Above `##@ Deployment` add the following:

        ```
        ...
        ifndef ignore-not-found
          ignore-not-found = false
        endif
        ...
        ```
        2) Replace:
        ```sh
        kubectl delete -f -
        ```
        With:
        ```sh
        kubectl delete --ignore-not-found=$(ignore-not-found) -f -
        ```
        **NOTE**  You can also compare your `Makefile` with the one tagged by this release, in `operator-sdk/testdata` of the [OperatorSDK](https://github.com/operator-framework/operator-sdk) project.
