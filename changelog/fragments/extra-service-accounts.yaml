      Added --extra-service-accounts flag to `generate bundle` to consider roles bound to
      service accounts not specified in the operator's Deployment.
    kind: addition
  - description: >
      `generate bundle` adds ClusterRoles bound by RoleBindings to a CSV's `.spec.permissions`,
      since these become namespace-scoped at runtime. They will also be added to `.spec.clusterPermissions`
      if bound by a ClusterRoleBinding.
    kind: change
