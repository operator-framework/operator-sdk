      (go/v3) Set the Makefile's `SHELL` variable to the system's `bash` binary with shell opts
    kind: bugfix
    migration:
      header: (go/v3) Set the Makefile's `SHELL` variable to the system's `bash` binary
      body: >
        Importing `setup-envtest.sh` needs bash, so your Makefile's `SHELL` variable should be set
        to `bash` with error options:

        ```diff
        else
        GOBIN=$(shell go env GOBIN)
        endif

        +# Setting SHELL to bash allows bash commands to be executed by recipes.
        +# This is a requirement for 'setup-envtest.sh' in the test target.
        +# Options are set to exit when a recipe line exits non-zero or a piped command fails.
        +SHELL = /usr/bin/env bash -o pipefail
        +.SHELLFLAGS = -ec
        +
        all: build
        ```
