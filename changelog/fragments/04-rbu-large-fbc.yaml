      For `operator-sdk run bundle(-upgrade)`: fix a bug in the logic that would attempt to
      create a `ConfigMap` that contained the entire contents of an FBC. Now if the FBC contents
      are to large to fit into a single `ConfigMap`, the FBC contents will be partitioned and split
      amongst multiple `ConfigMap` resources.
