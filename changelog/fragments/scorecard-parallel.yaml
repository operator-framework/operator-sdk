      enable parallelism within each stage.

      header: Add stages to scorecard configuration file
      body: |
        Update your scorecard configuration file to contain a new top-level
        stages field, and move your test definitions under one or more stages.

        **Example**
          
        ```yaml
        tests:
        - image: quay.io/operator-framework/scorecard-test:dev
          entrypoint:
          - scorecard-test
          - basic-check-spec
          labels:
            suite: basic
            test: basic-check-spec-test
        ```

        should be converted to

        ```yaml
        stages:
        - tests:
          - image: quay.io/operator-framework/scorecard-test:dev
            entrypoint:
            - scorecard-test
            - basic-check-spec
            labels:
              suite: basic
              test: basic-check-spec-test
        ```
