      For Ansible & Helm-based operators, the generated `Makefile` does not
      handle converting `aarch64` to `arm64`. This prevents it from downloading
      the appropriate binaries.

      This change simply adds a call to `sed` to convert `aarch64` to `arm64`.

      header: Support for arm64
      body: >
        In Ansible & Helm-based operators, if you need to support `arm64`, add the following

          `| sed 's/aarch64/arm64/'` 

        on the following line

          `ARCH := $(shell uname -m | sed 's/x86_64/amd64/')`

        The resulting line should look like this

          `ARCH := $(shell uname -m | sed 's/x86_64/amd64/' | sed 's/aarch64/arm64/')`
