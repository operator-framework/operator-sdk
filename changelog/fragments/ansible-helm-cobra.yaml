      header: Use new logging flags when running the Ansible and Helm operators
      body: |
        The Ansible and Helm operators now use controller-runtime's zap package
        to define logging flags.

        The `--zap-sample` and `--zap-time-encoding` flag have been removed since
        they are not present in controller-runtime's flagset. These flags are no
        longer supported.

        The `--zap-level` flag is called `--zap-log-level` now. Rename any usage of
        `--zap-level` to `--zap-log-level`

      The Ansible and Helm operators have a `version` subcommand that prints the
      version information for the `ansible-operator` and `helm-operator` binaries.

      The Ansible and Helm operators now use a `run` subcommand to run the operator
    kind: change
    breaking: true
    migration:
      header: Core Ansible and Helm operator logic moved to `run` subcommand
      body: |
        If you are using the `ansible-operator` and `helm-operator` binaries
        directly, update your usage to call `ansible-operator run` and
        `helm-operator run` (e.g. in your Makefile's `make run` target).

        If you are using the base image and you are not overriding the operator
        entrypoint, no change is necessary because the base image has been updated
        to call the `run` subcommand by default.
