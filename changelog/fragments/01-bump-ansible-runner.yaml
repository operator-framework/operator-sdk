      header: (Optional) Update local version of `ansible-runner`
      body: >
        `ansible-runner` 2.0+ includes a backwards incompatible change in the
        command signature, so in order to use `make run` with Ansible-based
        operators, users will need to upgrade their local version of
        `ansible-runner` to 2.0.2+
