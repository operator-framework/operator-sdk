      header: Update custom scorecard test example
      body: |
        The custom-scorecard-tests image is built like the other
        scorecard images with this change, the Makefile is updated
        to produce the custom-scorecard-tests image.  This makes it
        easier to build the image using the normal build process and
        will make testing the custom image easier, which will be
        addressed in another PR.
