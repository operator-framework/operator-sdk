      header: "Helm: rename condition reason `UpdateSuccessful` to `UpgradeSuccessful`"
      body: |
        For Helm-based operators to be more aligned with Helm, the `UpdateSuccessful` condition
        reason was renamed to `UpgradeSuccessful` for the `ReleaseFailed` condition.
        Note that this is **NOT** a breaking change for Helm-based operators themselves.
        However, any script or code that is depending on this condition reason must be updated
        to use `UpgradeSuccessful` instead of `UpdateSuccessful`.
