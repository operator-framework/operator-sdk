      Changed default API version for new Helm-based operators
      to `helm.operator-sdk/v1alpha1`. The `k8s.io` domain is
      reserved, so CRDs should not use it without explicit appproval.
      See the [API Review Process](https://github.com/kubernetes/community/blob/81ec4af0ed02b4c5c0917a16563250b2f45250c2/sig-architecture/api-review-process.md#mandatory) for details.

      header: Helm-based operators should not use `k8s.io` API version suffix
      body: |-
        Newly created Helm-based operators no longer use the `k8s.io` domain
        suffix as a default API version because it is reserved. APIs and CRDs
        using this domain [require API review][api-review] and approval.
        Existing projects that do not have this approval should migrate to use
        a new CRD API version suffix.

        Make the following changes to migrate to a new group name:
  
          - `watches.yaml` - Update the `group` field.
          - `deploy/role.yaml` - Update the `apiGroups` field in the policy rule giving access to the CRD.
          - `deploy/crds/`
            - Update the `metadata.name` and `spec.group` fields in the CRD files.
            - Update the `apiVersion` field in the CR files.
            - Rename the CRD and CR files to reflect the new group name.
