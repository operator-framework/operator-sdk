      For Ansible/Helm based-operators, upgrade the `kube-rbac-proxy` image version from `0.5.0` to `0.8.0` to address security concerns. More info [#kubernetes-sigs/kubebuilder#1955](https://github.com/kubernetes-sigs/kubebuilder/pull/1955).
    kind: "bugfix"
    breaking: false
    header: (ansible/v1, helm/v1) Upgrade the `gcr.io/kubebuilder/kube-rbac-proxy` image version from `0.5.0` to `0.8.0`
    body: >
      The 0.8.0 version of kube-rbac-proxy supports rootless run mode.
      To take advantage of this and other features, replace `gcr.io/kubebuilder/kube-rbac-proxy:v0.5.0`
      with `gcr.io/kubebuilder/kube-rbac-proxy:v0.8.0` in your `config/default/manager_auth_proxy_patch.yaml` file.
