    body: >
      The 0.8.0 version of kube-rbac-proxy supports rootless run mode.
      To take advantage of this and other features, replace `gcr.io/kubebuilder/kube-rbac-proxy:v0.5.0`
      with `gcr.io/kubebuilder/kube-rbac-proxy:v0.8.0` in your `config/default/manager_auth_proxy_patch.yaml` file.
