      Currently, when setting `overrideValues` in your `watches.yaml`, every entry is logged with its key and its value.
      When working with confidential information such as credentials, logging those information would not be optimal nor
      desirable. Therefore, there should be a way to silence/suppress these values.
      
      This feature introduces the `--suppress-override-values` boolean-flag for the `helm-operator`. When set to true,
      the value of the overrideValues entry is sanitized with this value "****".
      
      This is a simple example of `overrideValues` of the `watches.yaml`
      ```yaml
      overrideValues:
        x: y
      ```
      
      The default-value of `--suppress-override-values` is `false` so therefore we would get this warning logged:
      `Chart value x overridden to y by operator's watches.yaml`

      When setting `--suppress-override-values` `true` the warning will be logged in the following manner:
      `Chart value x overridden to **** by operator's watches.yaml`
