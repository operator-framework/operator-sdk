      (go/v3) Fixed a bug in `make test` caused by incorrect envtest asset setup.

    kind: "change"

    # Is this a breaking change?
    breaking: false

    migration:
      header: (go/v3) Export `KUBEBUILDER_ASSETS` in `Makefile`
      body: >
        In `go/v3` projects, after installing `setup-envtest` binary, the path to
        `KUBEBUILDER_ASSETS` needs to be exported. In `Makefile`, add the following:

          ```diff
            +# ENVTEST_K8S_VERSION refers to the version of kubebuilder assets to be downloaded by envtest binary.
            +ENVTEST_K8S_VERSION = 1.21

            test: manifests generate fmt vet envtest ## Run tests.
            - go test ./... -coverprofile cover.out
            + KUBEBUILDER_ASSETS="$(shell $(ENVTEST) use $(ENVTEST_K8S_VERSION) -p path)" go test ./... -coverprofile cover.out
          ```

      (go/v3, ansible/v1, helm/v1) Added `containerPort` protocol field required for server-side apply in manifests.

    kind: "addition"

    # Is this a breaking change?
    breaking: false

    migration:
      header: (go/v3, ansible/v1, helm/v1) Add `containerPort` protocol field in manifests.
      body: >
        In `go/v3`, `ansible/v1`, `helm/v1` projects, specify the `containerPort` protocol in the following files:
        - `config/default/manager_auth_proxy_patch.yaml`
        - `config/rbac/auth_proxy_service.yaml`

        ```diff
          ports:
         - containerPort: 8443
         + protocol: TCP
           name: https
        ```

        Additionally, in `go/v3` projects, add the `containerPort` protocol to `config/webhook/service.yaml`:

        ```diff
           ports:
            - port: 443
            + protocol: TCP
              targetPort: 9443
        ```

    kind: "change"

    # Is this a breaking change?

    migration:
      header: (go/v3, ansible/v1, helm/v1) Increase resource limits for controller manager.
      body: >
        In `go/v3`, `ansible/v1`, `helm/v1` projects, increase the `cpu` and `memory` resource limits to `200m` and
        `100Mi` respectively in `config/manager/manager.yaml`.

        ```diff
          resources:
           limits:
            - cpu: 100m
            - memory: 30Mi
            + cpu: 200m
            + memory: 100Mi
        ```
