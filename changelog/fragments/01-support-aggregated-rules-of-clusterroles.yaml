      The bundle generator now includes policy rules from ClusterRoles originating through AggregationRule.
      Previously, only policy rules of ClusterRoles explicitly bound to ServiceAccounts via ClusterRoleBindings were included.
      With this update, the generator also aggregates and applies rules from matching ClusterRoles, 
      ensuring proper RBAC coverage.
