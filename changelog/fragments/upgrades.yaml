        Following the steps to update your project.
        1) Update the go.mod file with:

        ```
        go 1.17

        require (
          github.com/onsi/ginkgo v1.16.5
          github.com/onsi/gomega v1.17.0
          k8s.io/api v0.23.0
          k8s.io/apimachinery v0.23.0
          k8s.io/client-go v0.23.0
          sigs.k8s.io/controller-runtime v0.11.0
        )
        ```
        2) Run `go mod tidy`

        Now, let's update the Makefile targets accordingly:

        1) Replace `ENVTEST_K8S_VERSION = 1.22` with `ENVTEST_K8S_VERSION = 1.23`
        2) Replace `sigs.k8s.io/controller-tools/cmd/controller-gen@v0.7.0` with `sigs.k8s.io/controller-tools/cmd/controller-gen@v0.8.0`
        3) Run `make manifests` and `make generate` to ensure that you will update your manifests with the new versions
        4) You might want to run `make all` to ensure that all updates were done accordinly and succeffully
