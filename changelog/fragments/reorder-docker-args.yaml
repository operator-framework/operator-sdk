    migration:
      header: Move positional directory argument `.` in `docker-build` make target
      body: >
        The directory argument `.` in the `docker-build` make target was moved to the
        last positional argument to align with `podman`'s expectations, making substitution
        cleaner. In your `Makefile`, change:

            docker build . -t ${IMG}

        to
             docker build -t ${IMG} .

        Alternatively, you could replace it programmatically

        ```sh
        sed -i 's/docker build . -t ${IMG}/docker build -t ${IMG} ./' $(git grep -l 'docker.*build \. ')
        ```
