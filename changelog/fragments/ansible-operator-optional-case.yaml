      The `snakeCaseParameters` option has been added to the `watches.yaml` for
      Ansible-based Operators. This allows the user to configure whether parameters
      in the resource spec are automatically converted from camelCase to snake_case.
      The default is `true`, so there is no behavior change for existing  operators,
      but it can now be disabled.
