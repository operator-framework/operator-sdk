      header: (ansible/v1) Bump Kuztomize version in helm project scaffolding to 3.8.7
      body: >
        Ansible projects are now scaffolded with `Kuztomize` version `3.8.7`. This version of kustomize
        requires that the path to patch file be provided with the `--path` flag in `add patch` command.
        In `molecule/default/prepare.yml` file, update the command under `Set pull policy`, to be:
        ```diff
             - name: Set pull policy
        -      command: '{{ "{{ kustomize }}" }} edit add patch pull_policy/{{ "{{ operator_pull_policy }}" }}.yaml'
        +      command: '{{ "{{ kustomize }}" }} edit add patch --path pull_policy/{{ "{{ operator_pull_policy }}" }}.yaml'
        ```
