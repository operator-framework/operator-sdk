      Support test selectors in scorecard-kuttl. This only works if you
      supply a test name in the config for the entrypoint in the scorecard test config.yaml

      In the `stages.tests`section add an `entrypoint`, in this entrypoint you add the
      name of the test you want to associate with the selector.

      If you have a kuttl test directory called `smoke` your entrypoint should have `- smoke`
      as an entry. That way scorecard can pass that into the image and kuttl will run the single
      test.
