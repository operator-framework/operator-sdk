      Prevent the ansible-operator from mangling variables containing the uppercase representations of special words (e.g IP, HTTP, etc).
    kind: change
    breaking: true

    migration:
      header: This new change will fix the ansible variables that are getting mangled
      body: >
        The input variables with special words such as IP,HTTP and URL in the string will get converted correctly to snake_case 
        with all the special word(s) not being split by `_` (the special word can be plural as well).

        For example: 

          egressIPs                    -->  egress_ips 

          URLsegressIPsEgressHTTPs     -->  _urls_egress_ips_egress_https
