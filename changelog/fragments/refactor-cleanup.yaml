      header: Update usage of `operator-sdk cleanup`
      body: |
        The `operator-sdk cleanup packagemanifests` command has been
        removed and replaced with a simpler `operator-sdk cleanup`
        command.

        Update usages of `operator-sdk cleanup packagemanifests` to
        use `operator-sdk cleanup <packageName>`.

        The value for `<packageName>` can be found in the `*.package.yaml`
        file in the root of your packagemanifests folder. It is typically
        your project name.
