      (ansible/v1) Previously, when scaffolding an Ansible-based operator with
      both Roles and Playbooks, the roles imported by the playbook could not be
      found when running locally (`make run`). This change prepends the
      `ANSIBLE_ROLES_PATH` environment variable with the path to the local
      roles directory.
    kind: "bugfix"
    breaking: false
    migration:
      header: (optional) Add local Ansible Roles path to Env in `make run`
      body: >
        If you would like to run your operator locally using `make run`, modify
        the `run` target in the `Makefile` to:
        `ANSIBLE_ROLES_PATH="$(ANSIBLE_ROLES_PATH):$(shell pwd)/roles"
        $(ANSIBLE_OPERATOR) run`
