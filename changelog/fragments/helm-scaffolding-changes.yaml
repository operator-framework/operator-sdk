      Helm scaffolding got modified in order to incorporate with Kubebuilder `--component-config` flag changes. Previously, it was scaffolding and doing some file changes without considering component-config flag.
      Now, this PR made changes which will consider the `--component-config` flag and modify the scaffolded file.

      1. If the `--component-config` flag is passed then look for `- /manager` in the file in order to add leader election id to the manager.yaml file. If flag is not passed then look for `--leader-elect`.
      2. Same logic for manager proxy patch file, look for `memory: 64Mi` if the flag is passed. If a flag is not passed then look for `--leader-elect`
      3. Repeat the same logic for replacing the port number from the file.
      4. At the end, update the `manager.yaml` file to avoid lint errors.
    kind: "change"
    breaking: false
