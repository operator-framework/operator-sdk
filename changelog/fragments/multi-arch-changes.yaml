      (ansible/v1, helm/v1) Added support to build multi-arch images
      from the project Makefile. A docker-buildx target will build
      the images for the platforms specified by the PLATFORMS variable.
    kind: "change"
    breaking: false # entries is a list of entries to include in

    # Migration can be defined to automatically add a section to
    # the migration guide. This is required for breaking changes.
    migration:
      header: For multi-arch build support, add docker-buildx target to project Makefile
      body: |

        In the project `Makefile` below the `docker-push` target add the new `docker-buildx`
        target.

        ```yaml
        # PLATFORMS defines the target platforms for  the manager image be build to provide support to multiple
        # architectures. (i.e. make docker-buildx IMG=myregistry/mypoperator:0.0.1). To use this option you need to:
        # - able to use docker buildx . More info: https://docs.docker.com/build/buildx/
        # - have enable BuildKit, More info: https://docs.docker.com/develop/develop-images/build_enhancements/
        # - be able to push the image for your registry (i.e. if you do not inform a valid value via IMG=<myregistry/image:<tag>> than the export will fail)
        # To properly provided solutions that supports more than one platform you should use this option.
        PLATFORMS ?= linux/arm64,linux/amd64,linux/s390x,linux/ppc64le
        .PHONY: docker-buildx
        docker-buildx: test ## Build and push docker image for the manager for cross-platform support
        	# copy existing Dockerfile and insert --platform=${BUILDPLATFORM} into Dockerfile.cross, and preserve the original Dockerfile
        	sed -e '1 s/\(^FROM\)/FROM --platform=\$$\{BUILDPLATFORM\}/; t' -e ' 1,// s//FROM --platform=\$$\{BUILDPLATFORM\}/' Dockerfile > Dockerfile.cross
        	- docker buildx create --name project-v3-builder
