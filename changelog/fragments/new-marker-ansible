        Add the variable `name: '{{ ansible_failed_task.name }}'` to the `Re-emit failure` in the `molecule/default/verify.yml` file which would like:

        ```yml
        - name: Re-emit failure
          vars:
            failed_task:
              name: '{{ ansible_failed_task.name }}'
              result: '{{ "{{ ansible_failed_result }}" }}'
            fail:
              msg: '{{ "{{ failed_task }}" }}'
        ```
