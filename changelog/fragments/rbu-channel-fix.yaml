      `operator-sdk run bundle(-upgrade)`: fixed bug that made it so bundles weren't properly upgraded if the 
      channel used in the bundle wasn't in the same channel as the bundle installed via `operator-sdk run bundle`.
      Using `operator-sdk run bundle` will now use a default channel instead of the one in the bundle.
    kind: "bugfix"
    breaking: false
