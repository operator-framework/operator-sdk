      header: (Optional) Update OLM bundle channel name
      body: >
        Channel names are used to imply what form of upgrade you want to offer for your operator which is integrated with OLM.
        By using the make target `make bundle` or the command `operator-sdk generate bundle` the default channel name configured
        for the bundle was `alpha` and from now on, SDK will use `preview` as default the channel name instead.

        To update the project bundle's channel name to the new default, run `make bundle`.
        To know more about the OLM channel name see: https://github.com/operator-framework/operator-lifecycle-manager/blob/master/doc/design/channel-naming.md#naming
