      For Go-based operators: Added `CONTAINER_TOOL` variable for setting of container tool for 
      building the operator, bundle and catalog images.

      By default, docker is used. 
      
      Use `CONTAINER_TOOL=podman` to build with podman. The settings can be passed to the make 
      commands by setting 'make <target> CONTAINER_TOOL=podman' or set in the `Makefile`. 

      The target names `docker-build`, `docker-push` in the `Makefile` are kept to keep backward compability.
