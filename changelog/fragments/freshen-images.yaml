      Images built from the operator-sdk repository for the latest two minor version's
      latest patch version will now be rebuilt whenever a constituent base image has a new patch version published.
      For example, running `docker pull quay.io/operator-framework/ansible-operator:v1.7.2` after a rebuild
      will result in a fully compatible, patched image.
    kind: change
