        Make the following update to your Makefile's `bundle` recipe, which will allow you to set `make bundle IMG=<tag>`:

        bundle: ...
          operator-sdk generate kustomize manifests -q
          cd config/manager && $(KUSTOMIZE) edit set image controller=$(IMG) # Add this line
          ...
        ```
