      header: Remove `olm-namespace` flag from `operator-sdk olm install` command
      body: |
        The `olm-namespace` flag has been removed from `operator-sdk olm install`
        command, as the olm manifests published in github have a hardcoded
        namespace value. Hence, the olm operators can only be installed in `olm`
        namespace using this command.
