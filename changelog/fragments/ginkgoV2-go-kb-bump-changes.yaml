      Modified go version to 1.19 and Kubebuilder to 3.7.1. The `config-gen` is 
      completely removed from Kubebuilder. As part of this bump, the 
      website content of SDK was updated where the doc is referring to 
      `config-gen`. 
    kind: "change"
    breaking: false
    migration:
      header: Kubebuilder bump brought changes that modified the `Makefile` scaffolding and also `multiarch` chanegs are also included.
      body: | 
        1. Makefile content is updated as shown below.

            ```sh
                `KUBEBUILDER_ASSETS="$(shell $(ENVTEST) use $(ENVTEST_K8S_VERSION) --bin-dir $(LOCALBIN) -p path)" go test ./... -coverprofile cover.out`,
            ```
        
        2. Add support for building binary in multiple platforms.
        
            Add the below content to the Makefile.
        
            ```sh
            # PLATFORMS defines the target platforms for  the manager image be build to provide support to multiple
            # architectures. (i.e. make docker-buildx IMG=myregistry/mypoperator:0.0.1). To use this option you need to:
            # - able to use docker buildx . More info: https://docs.docker.com/build/buildx/
            # - have enable BuildKit, More info: https://docs.docker.com/develop/develop-images/build_enhancements/
            # - be able to push the image for your registry (i.e. if you do not inform a valid value via IMG=<myregistry/image:<tag>> than the export will fail)
            # To properly provided solutions that supports more than one platform you should use this option.
            PLATFORMS ?= linux/arm64,linux/amd64,linux/s390x,linux/ppc64le
            .PHONY: docker-buildx
            docker-buildx: test ## Build and push docker image for the manager for cross-platform support
              # copy existing Dockerfile and insert --platform=${BUILDPLATFORM} into Dockerfile.cross, and preserve the original Dockerfile
              sed -e '1 s/\(^FROM\)/FROM --platform=\$$\{BUILDPLATFORM\}/; t' -e ' 1,// s//FROM --platform=\$$\{BUILDPLATFORM\}/' Dockerfile > Dockerfile.cross
              - docker buildx create --name project-v3-builder
              docker buildx use project-v3-builder
              - docker buildx build --push --platform=$(PLATFORMS) --tag ${IMG} -f Dockerfile.cross
              - docker buildx rm project-v3-builder
              rm Dockerfile.cross
            ```
        3. (go/v3) Bump dependencies in go.mod file
