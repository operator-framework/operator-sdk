      Deprecated `operator-sdk generate packagemanifests` and `operator-sdk run packagemanifests`
      commands, packagemanifests support in general in favour of operator bundles.

    kind: "deprecation"

    migration:
      header: Deprecate support for packagemanifests.
      body: >
        The operator-framework is removing support for the packagemanifests format in the near future.
        Hence, `operator-sdk generate packagemanifests` and `operator-sdk run packagemanifests` commands
        are deprecated. In order to migrate packagemanifests to bundles, `operator-sdk pkgman-to-bundle`
        command can be used. Run `operator-sdk pkgman-to-bundle --help` for more details.
