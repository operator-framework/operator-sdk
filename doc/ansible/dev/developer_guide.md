# Developer guide

This document provides some useful information and tips for a developer
creating an operator powered by Ansible.

## Getting started with the k8s Ansible modules

Since we are interested in using Ansible for the lifecycle management of our
application on Kubernetes, it is beneficial for a developer to get a good grasp
of the [k8s Ansible module][k8s_ansible_module]. This Ansible module allows a
developer to either leverage their existing Kubernetes resource files (written
in YaML) or express the lifecycle management in native Ansible. One of the
biggest benefits of using Ansible in conjunction with existing Kubernetes
resource files is the ability to use Jinja templating so that you can customize
deployments with the simplicity of a few variables in Ansible.

The easiest way to get started is to install the modules on your local machine
and test them using a playbook.

### Installing the k8s Ansible modules

To install the k8s Ansible modules, one must first install Ansible 2.6+. On
Fedora/Centos:
```bash
$ sudo dnf install ansible
```

In addition to Ansible, a user must install the [Openshift Restclient
Python][openshift_restclient_python] package. This can be installed from pip:
```bash
$ pip install openshift
```

### Testing the k8s Ansible modules locally

Sometimes it is beneficial for a developer to run the Ansible code from their
local machine as opposed to running/rebuilding the operator each time. To do
this, initialize a new project:
```bash
$ operator-sdk new --type ansible --kind Foo --api-version foo.example.com/v1alpha1 foo-operator
Create foo-operator/tmp/init/galaxy-init.sh 
Create foo-operator/tmp/build/Dockerfile 
Create foo-operator/tmp/build/test-framework/Dockerfile 
Create foo-operator/tmp/build/go-test.sh 
Rendering Ansible Galaxy role [foo-operator/roles/Foo]...
Cleaning up foo-operator/tmp/init
Create foo-operator/watches.yaml 
Create foo-operator/deploy/rbac.yaml 
Create foo-operator/deploy/crd.yaml 
Create foo-operator/deploy/cr.yaml 
Create foo-operator/deploy/operator.yaml 
Run git init ...
Initialized empty Git repository in /home/dymurray/go/src/github.com/dymurray/opsdk/foo-operator/.git/
Run git init done

$ cd foo-operator
```

Modify `roles/Foo/tasks/main.yml` with desired Ansible logic. For this example
we will create and delete a namespace with the switch of a variable:
```yaml
---
- name: set test namespace to {{ state }}
  k8s:
    api_version: v1
    kind: Namespace
    state: "{{ state }}"
  ignore_errors: true
```
**note**: Setting `ignore_errors: true` is done so that deleting a nonexistent
project doesn't error out.

Modify `roles/Foo/defaults/main.yml` to set `state` to `present` by default.
```yaml
---
state: present
```

Create an Ansible playbook `playbook.yaml` in the top-level directory which
includes role `Foo`:
```yaml
---
- hosts: localhost
  roles:
    - Foo
```

Run the playbook:
```bash
$ ansible-playbook playbook.yaml
 [WARNING]: provided hosts list is empty, only localhost is available. Note that the implicit localhost does not match 'all'


PLAY [localhost] ***************************************************************************

TASK [Gathering Facts] *********************************************************************
ok: [localhost]

Task [Foo : set test namespace to present]
changed: [localhost]

PLAY RECAP *********************************************************************************
localhost                  : ok=2    changed=1    unreachable=0    failed=0

```

Check that the namespace was created:
```bash
$ kubectl get namespace
NAME          STATUS    AGE
default       Active    28d
kube-public   Active    28d
kube-system   Active    28d
test          Active    3s
```

Rerun the playbook setting `state` to `absent`:
```bash
$ ansible-playbook playbook.yml --extra-vars state=absent
 [WARNING]: provided hosts list is empty, only localhost is available. Note that the implicit localhost does not match 'all'


PLAY [localhost] ***************************************************************************

TASK [Gathering Facts] *********************************************************************
ok: [localhost]

Task [Foo : set test namespace to absent]
changed: [localhost]

PLAY RECAP *********************************************************************************
localhost                  : ok=2    changed=1    unreachable=0    failed=0

```

Check that the namespace was deleted:
```bash
$ kubectl get namespace
NAME          STATUS    AGE
default       Active    28d
kube-public   Active    28d
kube-system   Active    28d
```
## Using Ansible inside of an Operator
Now that we have demonstrated using the Ansible Kubernetes modules, we want to
trigger this Ansible logic when a custom resource changes. In the above
example, we want to map a role to a specific Kubernetes resource that the
operator will watch. This mapping is done in a file called `watches.yaml`.

### Custom Resource file

The Custom Resource file format is Kubernetes resource file. The object has
mandatory fields:

**apiVersion**:  The version of the Custom Resource that will be created.

**kind**:  The kind of the Custom Resource that will be created

**metadata**:  Kubernetes specific metadata to be created

**spec**:  This is the key-value list of variables which are passed to Ansible.
This field is optional and will be empty by default.

**annotations**: Kubernetes specific annotations to be appened to the CR. See
the below section for Ansible Operator specifc annotations.

#### Ansible Operator annotations
This is the list of CR annotations which will modify the behavior of the operator:

**ansible.operator-sdk/reconcile-period**: Used to specify the reconciliation
interval for the CR. This value is parsed using the standard Golang package
[time][time_pkg]. Specifically [ParseDuration][time_parse_duration] is used
which will apply the default suffix of `s` giving the value in seconds.

Example:
```
apiVersion: "foo.example.com/v1alpha1"
kind: "Foo"
metadata:
  name: "example"
annotations:
  ansible.operator-sdk/reconcile-period: "30s"
```

### Testing an Ansible operator locally

Once a developer is comfortable working with the above workflow, it will be
beneficial to test the logic inside of an operator. To accomplish this, we can
use `operator-sdk up local` from the top-level directory of our project. The
`up local` command reads from `./watches.yaml` and uses `~/.kube/config` to
communicate with a kubernetes cluster just as the `k8s` modules do. This
section assumes the developer has read the [Ansible Operator user
guide][ansible_operator_user_guide] and has the proper dependencies installed.

Since `up local` reads from `./watches.yaml`, there are a couple options
available to the developer. If `role` is left alone (by default
`/opt/ansible/roles/<name>`) the developer must copy the role over to
`/opt/ansible/roles` from the operator directly. This is cumbersome because
changes will not be reflected from the current directory. It is recommended
that the developer instead change the `role` field to point to the current
directory and simply comment out the existing line:
```yaml
- version: v1alpha1
  group: foo.example.com
  kind: Foo
  #  role: /opt/ansible/roles/Foo
  role: /home/user/foo-operator/Foo
```

Create a Custom Resource Definiton (CRD) and proper Role-Based Access Control
(RBAC) definitions for resource Foo. `operator-sdk` autogenerates these files
inside of the `deploy` folder:
```bash
$ kubectl create -f deploy/crds/foo_v1alpha1_foo_crd.yaml
$ kubectl create -f deploy/service_account.yaml
$ kubectl create -f deploy/role.yaml
$ kubectl create -f deploy/role_binding.yaml
```

Run the `up local` command:
```bash
$ operator-sdk up local
INFO[0000] Go Version: go1.10.3                         
INFO[0000] Go OS/Arch: linux/amd64                      
INFO[0000] operator-sdk Version: 0.0.6+git              
INFO[0000] Starting to serve on 127.0.0.1:8888
         
INFO[0000] Watching foo.example.com/v1alpha1, Foo, default 
```

Now that the operator is watching resource `Foo` for events, the creation of a
Custom Resource will trigger our Ansible Role to be executed. Take a look at
`deploy/cr.yaml`:
```yaml
apiVersion: "foo.example.com/v1alpha1"
kind: "Foo"
metadata:
  name: "example"
```

Since `spec` is not set, Ansible is invoked with no extra variables. The next
section covers how extra variables are passed from a Custom Resource to
Ansible. This is why it is important to set sane defaults for the operator.

Create a Custom Resource instance of Foo with default var `state` set to
`present`:
```bash
$ kubectl create -f deploy/cr.yaml
```

Check that namespace `test` was created:
```bash
$ kubectl get namespace
NAME          STATUS    AGE
default       Active    28d
kube-public   Active    28d
kube-system   Active    28d
test          Active    3s
```

Modify `deploy/cr.yaml` to set `state` to `absent`:
```yaml
apiVersion: "foo.example.com/v1alpha1"
kind: "Foo"
metadata:
  name: "example"
spec:
  state: "absent"
```

Apply the changes to Kubernetes and confirm that the namespace is deleted:
```bash
$ kubectl apply -f deploy/cr.yaml
$ kubectl get namespace
NAME          STATUS    AGE
default       Active    28d
kube-public   Active    28d
kube-system   Active    28d
```

### Testing an Ansible operator on a cluster

Now that a developer is confident in the operator logic, testing the operator
inside of a pod on a Kubernetes cluster is desired. Running as a pod inside a
Kubernetes cluster is preferred for production use.

To build the `foo-operator` image and push it to a registry:
```
$ operator-sdk build quay.io/example/foo-operator:v0.0.1
$ docker push quay.io/example/foo-operator:v0.0.1
```

Kubernetes deployment manifests are generated in `deploy/operator.yaml`. The
deployment image in this file needs to be modified from the placeholder
`REPLACE_IMAGE` to the previous built image. To do this run:
```
$ sed -i 's|REPLACE_IMAGE|quay.io/example/foo-operator:v0.0.1|g' deploy/operator.yaml
```

**Note**  
If you are performing these steps on OSX, use the following command:
```
$ sed -i "" 's|REPLACE_IMAGE|quay.io/example/foo-operator:v0.0.1|g' deploy/operator.yaml
```

Deploy the foo-operator:

```sh
$ kubectl create -f deploy/crds/foo_v1alpha1_foo_crd.yaml # if CRD doesn't exist already
$ kubectl create -f deploy/service_account.yaml
$ kubectl create -f deploy/role.yaml
$ kubectl create -f deploy/role_binding.yaml
$ kubectl create -f deploy/operator.yaml
```

Verify that the foo-operator is up and running:

```sh
$ kubectl get deployment
NAME                     DESIRED   CURRENT   UP-TO-DATE   AVAILABLE   AGE
foo-operator       1         1         1            1           1m
```

## Extra vars sent to Ansible
The extra vars that are sent to Ansible are managed by the operator. The `spec`
section will pass along the key-value pairs as extra vars.  This is equivalent
to how above extra vars are passed in to `ansible-playbook`. The operator also
passes along additional variables under the `meta` field for the name of the CR
and the namespace of the CR.

For the CR example:
```yaml
apiVersion: "app.example.com/v1alpha1"
kind: "Database"
metadata:
  name: "example"
spec:
  message:"Hello world 2"
  newParameter: "newParam"
```

The structure passed to Ansible as extra vars is:


```json
{ "meta": {
        "name": "<cr-name>",
        "namespace": "<cr-namespace>",
  },
  "message": "Hello world 2",
  "new_parameter": "newParam",
  "_app_example_com_database": {
     <Full CRD>
   },
}
```
`message` and `newParameter` are set in the top level as extra variables, and
`meta` provides the relevant metadata for the Custom Resource as defined in the
operator. The `meta` fields can be accesses via dot notation in Ansible as so:
```yaml
---
- debug:
    msg: "name: {{ meta.name }}, {{ meta.namespace }}"
```
