## operator-sdk olm-catalog gen-csv

Generates a Cluster Service Version yaml file for the operator

### Synopsis

The gen-csv command generates a Cluster Service Version (CSV) YAML manifest
for the operator. This file is used to publish the operator to the OLM Catalog.

A CSV semantic version is supplied via the --csv-version flag. If your operator
has already generated a CSV manifest you want to use as a base, supply its
version to --from-version. Otherwise the SDK will scaffold a new CSV manifest.

```
operator-sdk olm-catalog gen-csv [flags]
