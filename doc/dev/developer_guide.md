# Developer guide

This document explains how to setup your dev environment.

## Prerequisites
- [dep][dep_tool] version v0.5.0+
- [git][git_tool]
- [go][go_tool] version v1.10+

## Download Operator SDK

Go to the [Operator SDK repo][repo_sdk] and follow the [fork guide][fork_guide] to fork, clone, and setup the local operator-sdk repository.

## Vendor dependencies

Run the following in the project root directory to update the vendored dependencies:

```sh
$ cd $GOPATH/src/github.com/operator-framework/operator-sdk
$ make dep
```

## Build the Operator SDK CLI

Build the Operator SDK CLI `operator-sdk` binary:

```sh
$ make install
```

## Testing

The SDK includes many tests that are run as part of CI.
To build the binary and run all tests (assuming you have a correctly configured environment),
you can simple run:

```sh
$ make test
```

For more information on running testing and correctly configuring your environment,
refer to the [`Running the Tests Locally`][running-the-tests] document.

See the project [README][sdk_readme] for more details.
