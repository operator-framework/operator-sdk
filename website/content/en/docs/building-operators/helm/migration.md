description: Instructions for migrating a legacy Helm-based project to use the new Kubebuilder-style layout.
---

This guide walks through an example of migrating a simple nginx-operator which was built by following the [legacy quick-start][quickstart-legacy] to the new layout.

## Overview

The motivations for the new layout are related to bringing more flexibility to users and 
part of the process to [Integrating Kubebuilder and Operator SDK][integration-doc].

### What was changed
 
The `deploy` directory was replaced with the `config` directory including a new layout of Kubernetes manifests files
- CRD's manifests in `deploy/crds/` are now in `config/crd/bases`
- CR's manifests in `deploy/crds/` are now in `config/samples`
- Controller manifest `deploy/operator.yaml` was replaced for `config/manager/manager.yaml` 
- RBCA's manifests in `deploy` are in `config/rbac/`

The `build/Dockerfile` directory was replaced by the `Dockerfile` in the root directory

### What is new

Projects are now scaffold using:

- [kustomize][kustomize] to manage Kubernetes resources needed to deploy your operator
- A `Makefile` with helpful targets for build, test, and deployment, and to give you flexibility to tailor things to your project's needs
- Updated metrics configuration using [kube-auth-proxy][kube-auth-proxy], a `--metrics-addr` flag, and [kustomize][kustomize]-based deployment of a Kubernetes `Service` and prometheus operator `ServiceMonitor`

## How to migrate

The easy migration path is to create a new project from the scratch and let the tool scaffold the files properly and then, 
just replace with your customizations and implementations. Following an example. 
 
### Creating a new project

In Kubebuilder-style projects, CRD groups are defined using two different flags
(`--group` and `--domain`).

When we initialize a new project, we need to specify the domain that _all_ APIs in
our project will share, so before creating the new project, we need to determine which
domain we're using for the APIs in our existing project.

To determine the domain, look at the `spec.group` field in your CRDs in the
`deploy/crds` directory.

The domain is everything after the first DNS segment. Using `cache.example.com` as an
example, the `--domain` would be `example.com`.

So let's create a new project with the same domain (`example.com`):

```sh
$ mkdir nginx-operator
$ cd nginx-operator
$ operator-sdk init --plugins=helm --domain=example.com
```

Now that we have our new project initialized, we need to re-create each of our APIs.
Using our API example from earlier (`cache.example.com`), we'll use `cache` for the
`--group` flag.

For `--version` and `--kind`, we use `spec.versions[0].name` and `spec.names.kind`, respectively.

For each API in the existing project, run:
```sh
$ operator-sdk create api \
    --group=cache \
    --version=<apiVersion> \
    --kind=<Kind> \
    --helm-chart=<path_to_existing_project>/helm-charts/<chart>
```

### Migrating your Custom Resource samples

Update the CR manifests in `config/samples` with the values of the CRs in your existing project which are in `deploy/crds/<group>_<version>_<kind>_cr.yaml`

### Migrating `watches.yaml`

Check if you have custom options in the `watches.yaml` file of your existing project. If so, update the new `watches.yaml` file to match. In our example, it will look like:

```yaml
# Use the 'create api' subcommand to add watches to this file.
- group: example.com
  version: v1alpha1
  kind: Nginx
  chart: helm-charts/nginx
# +kubebuilder:scaffold:watch
```

**NOTE**: Do not remove the `+kubebuilder:scaffold:watch` [marker][marker]. It allows the tool to update the watches file when new APIs are created. 

### Checking the Permissions (RBAC)

In your new project, roles are automatically generated in `config/rbac/role.yaml`.
If you modified these permissions manually in `deploy/role.yaml` in your existing
project, you need to re-apply them in `config/rbac/role.yaml`.

New projects are configured to watch all namespaces by default, so they need a `ClusterRole` to have the necessary permissions. Ensure that `config/rbac/role.yaml` remains a `ClusterRole` if you want to retain the default behavior of the new project conventions. For further information refer to the [operator scope][operator-scope] documentation.  

The following rules were used in earlier versions of helm-operator to automatically create and manage services and servicemonitors for metrics collection. If your operator's charts don't require these rules, they can safely be left out of the new `config/rbac/role.yaml` file:

```yaml  
  - apiGroups:
    - monitoring.coreos.com
    resources:
    - servicemonitors
    verbs:
    - get
    - create
  - apiGroups:
    - apps
    resourceNames:
    - memcached-operator
    resources:
    - deployments/finalizers
    verbs:
    - update
```

### Configuring your Operator

If your existing project has customizations in `deploy/operator.yaml`, they need to be ported to 
`config/manager/manager.yaml`. If you are passing custom arguments in your deployment, make sure to also update `config/default/auth_proxy_patch.yaml`.

Note that the following environment variables are no longer used. 

- `OPERATOR_NAME` is deprecated. It is used to define the name for a leader election config map. Operator authors should begin using `--leader-election-id` instead.
- `POD_NAME` was used to enable a particular pod to hold the leader election lock when the Helm operator used the leader for life mechanism. Helm operator now uses controller-runtime's leader with lease mechanism, and `POD_NAME` is no longer necessary.

## Exporting metrics 

If you are using metrics and would like to keep them exported you will need to configure 
it in the `config/default/kustomization.yaml`. Please see the [metrics][metrics] doc to know how you can perform this setup. 

The default port used by the metric endpoint binds to was changed from `:8383` to `:8080`. To continue using port `8383`, specify `--metrics-addr=:8383` when you start the operator. 

## Checking the changes

Finally, follow the steps in the section [Build and run the operator][build-and-run-the-operator] to verify your project is running.
