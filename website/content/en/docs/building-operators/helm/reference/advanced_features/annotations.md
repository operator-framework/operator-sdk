## `helm.sdk.operatorframework.io/upgrade-force`

This annotation can be set to `"true"` on custom resources to enable the chart to be upgraded with the
`helm upgrade --force` option. For more info see the [Helm Upgrade documentation](https://helm.sh/docs/helm/helm_upgrade/)
and this [explanation](https://github.com/helm/helm/issues/7082#issuecomment-559558318) of `--force` behavior.

**Example**

```yaml
apiVersion: example.com/v1alpha1
kind: Nginx
metadata:
  name: nginx-sample
  annotations:
    helm.sdk.operatorframework.io/upgrade-force: "true"
spec:
  replicaCount: 2
  service:
    port: 8080
```

Setting this annotation to `true` and making a change to trigger an upgrade (e.g. setting `spec.replicaCount: 3`)
will cause the custom resource to be reconciled and upgraded with the `force` option. This can be verified in the
log message when an upgrade succeeds:

```
{"level":"info","ts":1591198931.1703992,"logger":"helm.controller","msg":"Upgraded release","namespace":"helm-nginx","name":"example-nginx","apiVersion":"cache.example.com/v1alpha1","kind":"Nginx","release":"example-nginx","force":true}
```

## `helm.sdk.operatorframework.io/uninstall-wait`

This annotation can be set to `"true"` on custom resources to enable the deletion to wait until all the resources in the
`status.deployedRelease.manifest` are deleted. 

**Example**

```yaml
apiVersion: example.com/v1alpha1
kind: Nginx
metadata:
  name: nginx-sample
  annotations:
    helm.sdk.operatorframework.io/uninstall-wait: "true"
spec:
...
status:
  ...
  deployedRelease:
    manifest: |

            protocol: TCP
            name: http
        selector:

          app.kubernetes.io/managed-by: Helm
      spec:
        replicas: 1
        selector:
          matchLabels:
            app.kubernetes.io/name: nginx
            app.kubernetes.io/instance: nginx-sample
        template:
          metadata:
            labels:
              app.kubernetes.io/name: nginx
              app.kubernetes.io/instance: nginx-sample
          spec:
            serviceAccountName: nginx-sample
            securityContext:
              {}
            containers:
              - name: nginx
                securityContext:
                  {}
                image: "nginx:1.16.0"
                imagePullPolicy: IfNotPresent
                ports:
                  - name: http
                    containerPort: 80
                    protocol: TCP
                livenessProbe:
                  httpGet:
                    path: /
                    port: http
                readinessProbe:
                  httpGet:
                    path: /
                    port: http
                resources:
                  {}
```

Setting this annotation to `true` and deleting the custom resource will cause the custom resource to be reconciled
continuously until all the resources in `status.deployedRelease.manifest` are deleted. This can be verified in the
log message when a delete has been triggered:

```
{"level":"info","ts":1612294054.5845876,"logger":"helm.controller","msg":"Uninstall wait","namespace":"default","name":"nginx-sample","apiVersion":"example.com/v1alpha1","kind":"Nginx","release":"nginx-sample"}

```

## `helm.sdk.operatorframework.io/reconcile-period`

While running a Helm-based operator, the reconcile-period can be specified through the custom resource's annotations under the `helm.sdk.operatorframework.io/reconcile-period` key. 
This feature guarantees that an operator will get reconciled, at minimum, in the specified interval of time. In other words, it ensures that the cluster will not go longer
than the specified reconcile-period without being reconciled. However, the cluster may be reconciled at any moment if there are changes detected in the desired state.

The reconcile period can be specified in the custom resource's annotations in the following manner: 

```sh
...
metadata:
  name: nginx-sample
  annotations:
    helm.sdk.operatorframework.io/reconcile-period: 5s
...
```

The value that is present under this key must be in the h/m/s format. For example, 1h2m4s, 3m0s, 4s are all valid values, but 1x3m9s is invalid. 

**NOTE**: This is just one way of specifying the reconcile period for Helm-based operators. There are two other ways: using the `--reconcile-period` command-line flag and under the 'reconcilePeriod' key in the watches.yaml file. If these three methods are used simultaneously to specify reconcile period (which they should not be), the order of precedence is as follows: 
Custom Resource Annotations > watches.yaml > command-line flag.
