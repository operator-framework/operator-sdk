# Adding Admission Webhooks to an Ansible-based Operator

## Background

For general background on what admission webhooks are, why to use them, and how to build them,
please refer to the official Kubernetes documentation on [Extensible Admission Controllers][admission-controllers]

This guide will assume that you understand the above content, and that you have an existing admission
webhook server. You will likely need to make a few modifications to the webhook server container.

When integrating an admission webhook server into your Ansible-based Operator, we recommend that you
deploy it as a sidecar container alongside your operator. This allows you to make use of the proxy
server that the operator deploys, as well as the cache that backs it. The sidecar will be defined in the `deploy/operator.yaml` and it will look like:

```yaml
...
# This deploys the webhook
        - name: webhook
          # Replace this with the built image name
          image: "REPLACE_WEBHOOK_IMAGE"
          imagePullPolicy: "Always"
          volumeMounts:
          - mountPath: /etc/tls/
            name: webhook-cert
...            

## Ensuring the webhook server uses the caching proxy

When an Ansible-based Operator runs, it creates a Kubernetes proxy server and serves it on
`http://localhost:8888`. This proxy server does not require any authorization, so all you need to
do to make use of the proxy is ensure that your Kubernetes client is pointing at `http://localhost:8888`
and that it does not attempt to verify SSL. If you use the default in-cluster configuration, you will
be hitting the real API server and will not get caching for free.

## Deploying the webhook server

To deploy the webhook server as a sidecar alongside your operator, all you need to do is add the container
specification to your `deploy/operator.yaml`. You may also need to add a volume for mounting in TLS secrets,
as your webhook server is required to have a valid SSL configuration. Below is a sample updated container
specification that deploys a webhook:

```yaml
      containers:
        - name: my-operator
          # Replace this with the built image name
          image: "REPLACE_IMAGE"
          imagePullPolicy: "Always"
          volumeMounts:
          - mountPath: /tmp/ansible-operator/runner
            name: runner
          env:
            - name: WATCH_NAMESPACE
              valueFrom:
                fieldRef:
                  fieldPath: metadata.namespace
            - name: POD_NAME
              valueFrom:
                fieldRef:
                  fieldPath: metadata.name
            - name: OPERATOR_NAME
              value: "validating-operator"
            - name: ANSIBLE_GATHERING
              value: explicit
        # This deploys the webhook
        - name: webhook
          # Replace this with the built image name
          image: "REPLACE_WEBHOOK_IMAGE"
          imagePullPolicy: "Always"
          volumeMounts:
          - mountPath: /etc/tls/
            name: webhook-cert
      volumes:
        - name: runner
          emptyDir: {}
        # This assumes there is a secret called webhook-cert containing TLS certificates
        # Projects like cert-manager can create these certificates
        - name: webhook-cert
          secret:
            secretName: webhook-cert
```

This will run your webhook server alongside the operator, but Kubernetes will not yet call the webhooks before
resources can be created. In order to let Kubernetes know about your webhooks, you must create specific API resources.

## Making Kubernetes call your webhooks

In order to make your webhooks callable at all, first you must create a `Service` that points at your
webhook server. Below is a sample service that creates a `Service` named `my-operator-webhook`, that will
send traffic on port `443` to port `5000` in a `Pod` that matches the selector `name=my-operator`. Modify these
values to match your environment.

```yaml
apiVersion: v1
kind: Service
metadata:
  name: my-operator-webhook
spec:
  ports:
  - name: webhook
    port: 443
    protocol: TCP
    # Change targetPort to match the port your server is listening on
    targetPort: 5000
  selector:
    # Change this selector to match the labels on your operator pod
    name: my-operator
  type: ClusterIP
```

Now that you have a `Service` directing traffic to your webhook server, you will need to create
[`MutatingWebhookConfiguration`][mutating-webhook] or [`ValidatingWebhookConfiguration`][validating-webhook] objects (depending on what type of webhook you have deployed), which will tell Kubernetes
to send certain API requests through your webhooks before writing to etcd.

Below are examples of both [`MutatingWebhookConfiguration`][mutating-webhook] and [`ValidatingWebhookConfiguration`][validating-webhook] objects,
which will tell Kubernetes to call the `my-operator-webhook` service when `samples.example.com Example` resources
are created. The mutating webhook is served on the `/mutating` path in my example webhook server, and the validating webhook is served on `/validating`. Update these values as needed to reflect your environment
and desired behavior. These objects are thoroughly documented in the official Kubernetes documentation on [Extensible Admission Controllers][admission-controllers]

```yaml
---
apiVersion: admissionregistration.k8s.io/v1
kind: MutatingWebhookConfiguration
metadata:
  name: mutating.example.com
webhooks:
- name: "mutating.example.com"
  rules:
  - apiGroups:   ["samples.example.com"]
    apiVersions: ["*"]
    operations:  ["CREATE"]
    resources:   ["examples"]
    scope:       "Namespaced"
  clientConfig:
    service:
      # Replace this with the namespace your service is in
      namespace: REPLACE_NAMESPACE
      name: my-operator-webhook
      path: /mutating
  admissionReviewVersions: ["v1"]
  sideEffects: None
---
apiVersion: admissionregistration.k8s.io/v1
kind: ValidatingWebhookConfiguration
metadata:
  name: validating.example.com
webhooks:
- name: validating.example.com
  rules:
  - apiGroups:   ["samples.example.com"]
    apiVersions: ["*"]
    operations:  ["CREATE"]
    resources:   ["examples"]
    scope:       "Namespaced"
  clientConfig:
    service:
      # Replace this with the namespace your service is in
      namespace: REPLACE_NAMESPACE
      name: my-operator-webhook
      path: /validating
  admissionReviewVersions: ["v1"]
  failurePolicy: Fail
  sideEffects: None
```

If these resources are configured properly you will now have an admissions webhook that can reject or mutate
incoming resources before they are written to the Kubernetes database.

## Summary

To deploy an existing admissions webhook to validate or mutate your Kubernetes resources alongside an 
Ansible-based Operator, you must
1. Configure your admissions webhook to use the proxy server running on `http://localhost:8888` in the operator pod
1. Add the webhook container to your operator deployment
1. Create a `Service` pointing to your webhook
1. Make sure your webhook is reachable via the `Service` over `https`
1. Create [`MutatingWebhookConfiguration`][mutating-webhook] or [`ValidatingWebhookConfiguration`][validating-webhook] mapping the resource you want to mutate/validate to the `Service` you created
