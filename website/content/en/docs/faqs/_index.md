## What are the the differences between Kubebuilder and Operator-SDK?

Kubebuilder and Operator SDK are both projects that allow you to quickly create and manage an operator project. Operator SDK uses Kubebuilder under the hood to do so for Go projects, such that the `operator-sdk` CLI tool will work with a project created by `kubebuilder`. Therefore each project makes use of [controller-runtime][controller-runtime] and will have the same [basic layout][kb-doc-what-is-a-basic-project].

Operator SDK offers additional features on top of the basic project scaffolding that Kubebuilder provides. By default, `operator-sdk init` generates a project integrated with: 
- [Operator Lifecycle Manager][olm], an installation and runtime management system for operators
- [OperatorHub][operatorhub.io], a community hub for publishing operators
- Operator SDK [scorecard][scorecard-doc], a tool for ensuring operator best-practices and developing cluster tests
Operator SDK supports operator types other than Go as well, such as Ansible and Helm.

For further context about the relationship between Kubebuilder and Operator SDK, see [this blog post][operator-sdk-reaches-v1.0].

## Controller Runtime FAQ

Please see the upstream [Controller Runtime FAQ][cr-faq] first for any questions related to runtime mechanics or controller-runtime APIs.

## How can I have separate logic for Create, Update, and Delete events? When reconciling an object can I access its previous state?

You should not have separate logic. Instead design your reconciler to be idempotent. See the [controller-runtime FAQ][controller-runtime_faq] for more details.

## When my Custom Resource is deleted, I need to know its contents or perform cleanup tasks. How can I do that?

Use a [finalizer].

## I see the warning in my Operator's logs: `The resourceVersion for the provided watch is too old.` What's wrong?

This is completely normal and expected behavior.

The `kube-apiserver` watch request handler is designed to periodically close a watch to spread out load among controller node instances. Once disconnected, your Operator's informer will automatically reconnect and re-establish the watch. If an event is missed during re-establishment, the watch will fail with the above warning message. The Operator's informer then does a list request and uses the new `resourceVersion` from that list to restablish the watch and replace the cache with the latest objects.

This warning should not be stifled. It ensures that the informer is not stuck or wedged.

Never seeing this warning may suggest that your watch or cache is not healthy. If the message is repeating every few seconds, this may signal a network connection problem or issue with etcd.

For more information on `kube-apiserver` request timeout options, see the [Kubernetes API Server Command Line Tool Reference][kube-apiserver_options]


## My Ansible module is missing a dependency. How do I add it to the image?

Unfortunately, adding the entire dependency tree for all Ansible modules would be excessive. Fortunately, you can add it easily. Simply edit your build/Dockerfile. You'll want to change to root for the install command, just be sure to swap back using a series of commands like the following right after the `FROM` line.

```docker
USER 0
RUN yum -y install my-dependency
RUN pip3 install my-python-dependency
USER 1001
```

If you aren't sure what dependencies are required, start up a container using the image in the `FROM` line as root. That will look something like this:
```sh
docker run -u 0 -it --rm --entrypoint /bin/bash quay.io/operator-framework/ansible-operator:<sdk-tag-version>
```

## I keep seeing errors like "Failed to watch", how do I fix this?

If you run into the following error message, it means that your operator is unable to watch the resource:

```
E0320 15:42:17.676888       1 reflector.go:280] pkg/mod/k8s.io/client-go@v0.0.0-20191016111102-bec269661e48/tools/cache/reflector.go:96: Failed to watch *v1.ImageStreamTag: unknown (get imagestreamtags.image.openshift.io)
{"level":"info","ts":1584718937.766342,"logger":"controller_memcached","msg":"ImageStreamTag resource not found.
```

Using controller-runtime's split client means that read operations (gets and lists) are read from a cache, and write operations are written directly to the API server. To populate the cache for reads, controller-runtime initiates a `list` and then a `watch` even when your operator is only attempting to `get` a single resource. The above scenario occurs when the operator does not have an [RBAC][rbac] permission to `watch` the resource. The solution is to add an RBAC directive to generate a `config/rbac/role.yaml` with `watch` privileges:

```go
// +kubebuilder:rbac:groups=some.group.com,resources=myresources,verbs=watch
```

Alternatively, if the resource you're attempting to cannot be watched (like `v1.ImageStreamTag` above), you can specify that objects of this type should not be cached by adding the following to `main.go`:

```go
import (
	...
	imagev1 "github.com/openshift/api/image/v1"
)

var (
	scheme = runtime.NewScheme()
)

func init() {
	utilruntime.Must(clientgoscheme.AddToScheme(scheme))
	// Add imagev1's scheme.
	utilruntime.Must(imagev1.AddToScheme(scheme))
}

func main() {
	mgr, err := ctrl.NewManager(ctrl.GetConfigOrDie(), ctrl.Options{
		Scheme:        scheme,
		// Specify that ImageStreamTag's should not be cached.
		ClientBuilder: manager.NewClientBuilder().WithUncached(&imagev1.ImageStreamTag{}),
	})
}
```

Then in your controller file, add an RBAC directive to generate a `config/rbac/role.yaml` with `get` privileges:

```go
// +kubebuilder:rbac:groups=image.openshift.io,resources=imagestreamtags,verbs=get
```

Now run `make manifests` to update your `role.yaml`.


## I keep hitting errors like "is forbidden: cannot set blockOwnerDeletion if an ownerReference refers to a resource you can't set finalizers on:", how do I fix this?

If you are facing this issue, it means that the operator is missing the required RBAC permissions to update finalizers on the APIs it manages. This permission is necessary if the [OwnerReferencesPermissionEnforcement][owner-references-permission-enforcement] plugin is enabled in your cluster.

For Helm and Ansible operators, this permission is configured by default. However for Go operators, it may be necessary to add this permission yourself
by adding an RBAC directive to generate a `config/rbac/role.yaml` with `update` privileges on your CR's finalizers:

```go
// +kubebuilder:rbac:groups=cache.example.com,resources=memcacheds/finalizers,verbs=update
```

Now run `make manifests` to update your `role.yaml`.
