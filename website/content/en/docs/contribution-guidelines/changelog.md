The Operator SDK project tracks changes across releases by maintaining a live changelog. This changelog is compiled via fragments located in `changelog/fragments`

Contributors are asked to add these changelog fragments when creating pull requests by following this [template][changelog-template].

The changlog fragments document the following information:

* Description of Changes
* Types of Changes
  * One of: addition, change, deprecation, removal, bugfix
* Migration Guide for Changes
  * These are required for breaking changes, and essential (but not required) for scaffolding-related changes.
