#### Q: If I find a problem, should I file a Pull Request or an Issue?

A: We suggest that you start by filing an issue to potentially save
contributors the implementation time if the change cannot be accepted
for some reason. However, if it is easier to just submit a PR that is
always fine. If you do choose to start with a Pull Request, please make
sure that the motivation is included.
