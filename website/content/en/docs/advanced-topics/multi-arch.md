### Supporting Multiple Architectures

Authors may decide to distribute their bundles for various architectures: x86_64, aarch64, ppc64le, s390x, etc, to accommodate the diversity of Kubernetes clusters and reach a larger number of potential users. Each architecture requires however compatible binaries.

#### Manifest lists

The most straightforward way of building operators and operands supporting multiple architectures is to leverage manifest lists, specified by [Image Manifest V2, Schema 2][manifest_list] or [OCI Image Index][image_index]. A manifest list points to specific image manifests for one or more platforms.

For convenience tools like [buildah][buildah] allow to cross-build and manifest multi-arch containers on one host. For instance with buildah:

```shell
for a in amd64 arm64 ppc64le s390x; do \
  buildah bud --manifest registry/username/repo:v1 --arch $a; \
done
```

This creates the manifest list, builds each image and adds them to the manifest list.

The result can then be pushed to the desired registry.

```shell
buildah push registry/username/repo:v1
```

Docker with [buildx][buildx] provides similar capabilities.

```shell
docker buildx build --push --platform linux/amd64,linux/arm64,linux/ppc64le,linux/s390x --tag registry/username/repo:v1 .
```

See [docker documentation][buildx_multiarch] for additional options.
 
**Caveats**: the Dockerfile generated by the SDK for the operator explicitly references GOARCH=amd64 for go build. This can be amended to GOARCH=$TARGETARCH. Docker will automatically set the environment variable to the value specified by --platform. With buildah --build-arg will need to be used for the purpose.

**Caveats**: When mirroring registries for disconnected installations (environments without internet connection) all the images referenced by a manifest list need to be copied, including images for architectures that may not be used in the environment.

#### Operator Lifecycle Manager

For operators distributed through the [Operator Lifecycle Manager (OLM)][olm]:

* [Bundle images][bundle] are not architecture-specific. They contain only plaintext kubernetes manifests and operator metadata.
* All image references in the ClusterServiceVersion should be manifest lists containing the pointers to the image manifests for the supported architectures.
* Labels for OS and architectures can be set in the CSV. Please refer to the [Operator Lifecycle Management Documentation][olm_multiarch] for details.
