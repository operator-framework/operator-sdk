This document describes how to manage the following lifecycle for your Operator using the SDK's [`operator-sdk generate csv`][generate-csv-cli] command:

- **Generate your first release** - encapsulate the metadata needed to install your Operator with the [Operator Lifecycle Manager][olm] and configure the permissions it needs from the generated SDK files.
- **Update your Operator** - apply any updates to Operator manifests made during development.
- **Upgrade your Operator** - carry over any customizations you have made and ensure a rolling update to the next version of your Operator.

**Note:** `operator-sdk generate csv` only officially supports Go Operators. Ansible and Helm Operators will be fully supported in the future. However, `generate csv` _may_ work with Ansible and Helm Operators if their project structure aligns with that described below.

## Configuration

### Inputs

The [ClusterServiceVersion (CSV)][doc-csv] generator requires certain input
manifests to construct a CSV manifest. Each of these inputs are read every time
`operator-sdk generate csv` is run are used to overwrite data in corresponding
CSV fields (with one exception described [below](#csv-fields)).

* Path to the Operator manifests root directory. By default `generate csv`
extracts manifests from files in `deploy/` for the following kinds and adds
them to the CSV. Use the `--deploy-dir` flag to change this path.
    * Roles: `deploy/role.yaml`
    * ClusterRoles: `deploy/cluster_role.yaml`
    * Deployments: `deploy/operator.yaml`
* Path to a directory containing CustomResourceDefinitions (CRDs) and Custom Resource examples (CRs).
Use the `--crd-dir` flag to change this path.
    * Custom Resources: `deploy/crds/<full group>_<version>_<kind>_cr.yaml`
    * CustomResourceDefinitions: `deploy/crds/<full group>_<resource>_crd.yaml`
* _For Go Operators only:_ Path to the API types root directory. The CSV generator
also parses the [CSV markers][csv-markers] from the API type definitions
to populate certain CSV fields. By default the API types directory is `pkg/apis/`.
Use the `--apis-dir` flag to change this path. The CSV generator expects either
of the following layouts for the API types directory.
    * Mulitple groups: `<API-root-dir>/<group>/<version>/`
    * Single groups: `<API-root-dir>/<version>/`
* Interactive command prompts: `operator-sdk generate csv` provides the `--interactive`
flag to optionally enable an interactive command prompt before generating a CSV
that requests input for required and optional UI metadata fields. For example:

  ```console
  $ operator-sdk generate csv  --csv-version 0.1.0 --interactive=true
  INFO[0000] Generating CSV manifest version 0.1.0

  Display name for the operator (required):
  > memcached

  Comma-separated list of keywords for your operator (required):
  > app, operator
  ...
  ```

  By default, the command starts an interactive prompt if some base CSV is not present,
  either in the destination directory or a package manifests directory named with version `--from-version=<version>`.

### Output

By default `generate csv` will create a CSV and copy CRDs in the [*bundle*][doc-bundle]
manifests format:

```
deploy/
└── olm-catalog
    └── <operator-name>
        └── manifests
            ├── cache.example.com_memcacheds_crd.yaml
            └── <operator-name>.clusterserviceversion.yaml
```

Setting `--make-manifests=false` will create a CSV and package manifest in the
[package manifests format](#package-manifests-format):

```
deploy/
└── olm-catalog
    └── <operator-name>
        ├── 0.0.1
        │   └── <operator-name>.v0.0.1.clusterserviceversion.yaml
        └── <operator-name>.package.yaml
```

Set the `--ouput-dir` flag to change where the CSV is generated.

**Note:** `generate csv` will populate many but not all fields in your CSV
automatically. Subsequent calls to `generate csv` will warn you of missing
required fields. See the list of fields [below](#csv-fields) for more information.

#### Bundle format (default)

CSV's are versioned by their `metadata.name` and `spec.version` fields and stored
in a bundle manifests directory. To create a CSV for version `0.0.1`, run:

```console
$ operator-sdk generate csv --csv-version 0.0.1
```

A CSV should now exist at `deploy/olm-catalog/<operator-name>/manifests/<operator-name>.clusterserviceversion.yaml`
with `<operator-name>.v0.0.1` and version `0.0.1`. This command will also copy all `CustomResourceDefinition`
manifests from `deploy/crds` or the value passed to `--crd-dir` to that CSV's directory.
Note that a valid semantic version is required.

#### Package manifests format

Setting `--make-manifests=false` will create a CSV in a versioned directory
`deploy/olm-catalog/<operator-name>/0.0.1/<operator-name>.v0.0.1.clusterserviceversion.yaml`:

```console
$ operator-sdk generate csv --make-manifests=false --csv-version 0.0.1
```

Setting `--update-crds=true` directs the generator to update bundled CRD manifests.

## Updating your CSV

Let's say you added a new CRD `deploy/crds/group.domain.com_resource_crd.yaml`
to your Operator project, and added a port to your Deployment manifest `operator.yaml`.
If using a bundle format, the current version of your CSV can be updated by running:

```console
$ operator-sdk generate csv
```

If using a package manifests format, run:

```console
$ operator-sdk generate csv --make-manifests=false --csv-version <existing-version>
```

Running the command for either format will append your new CRD to `spec.customresourcedefinitions.owned`,
replace the old data at `spec.install.spec.deployments` with your updated Deployment,
and update your existing CSV manifest. The SDK will not overwrite [user-defined](#csv-fields)
fields like `spec.maintainers`.

## Upgrading your CSV

Lets say you're upgrading your Operator version. If using a bundle format,
a new version of your CSV can be created by running:

```console
$ operator-sdk generate csv --csv-version <new-version>
```

If using a package manifests format, run:

```console
$ operator-sdk generate csv --make-manifests=false --csv-version <new-version> --from-version <old-version>
```

Running the command for either format will persist user-defined fields,
updates `spec.version`, and populates `spec.replaces` with the old CSV versions' name.

## CSV fields

Below are two lists of fields: the first is a list of all fields the SDK and OLM expect in a CSV, and the second are optional.

_For Go Operators only:_ Several fields require user input (labeled _user_) or a [CSV marker][csv-markers] (labeled _marker_). This list may change as the SDK becomes better at generating CSV's.

Required:

* `metadata.name`: a *unique* name for this CSV. Operator version should be included in the name to ensure uniqueness, ex. `app-operator.v0.1.1`.
* `spec.description` _(user)_ : a thorough description of the Operator's functionality.
* `spec.displayName` _(user)_ : a name to display for the Operator in Operator Hub.
* `spec.keywords` _(user)_ : a list of keywords describing the Operator.
* `spec.maintainers` _(user)_ : a list of human or organizational entities maintaining the Operator, with a `name` and `email`.
* `spec.provider` _(user)_ : the Operator provider, with a `name`; usually an organization.
* `spec.labels` _(user)_ : a list of `key:value` pairs to be used by Operator internals.
* `spec.version`: semantic version of the Operator, ex. `0.1.1`.
* `spec.installModes`: what mode of [installation namespacing][install-modes] OLM should use. Currently all but `MultiNamespace` are supported by SDK Operators.
* `spec.customresourcedefinitions`: any CRDs the Operator uses. Certain fields in elements of `owned` will be filled by the SDK.
    * `owned`: all CRDs the Operator deploys itself from it's bundle.
        * `name`: CRD's `metadata.name`.
        * `kind`: CRD's `metadata.spec.names.kind`.
        * `version`: CRD's `metadata.spec.version`.
        * `description` _(marker)_ : description of the CRD.
        * `displayName` _(marker)_ : display name of the CRD.
        * `resources` _(marker)_ : any Kubernetes resources used by the CRD, ex. `Pod`'s and `ConfigMap`'s.
        * `specDescriptors` _(marker)_ : UI hints for inputs and outputs of the Operator's spec.
        * `statusDescriptors` _(marker)_ : UI hints for inputs and outputs of the Operator's status.
        * `actionDescriptors` _(user)_ : UI hints for an Operator's in-cluster actions.
    * `required` _(user)_ : all CRDs the Operator expects to be present in-cluster, if any. All `required` element fields must be populated manually.

Optional:

* `metadata.annotations.alm-examples`: CR examples, in JSON string literal format, for your CRD's. Ideally one per CRD.
* `metadata.annotations.capabilities`: level of Operator capability. See the [Operator maturity model][olm-capabilities] for a list of valid values.
* `spec.replaces`: the name of the CSV being replaced by this CSV.
* `spec.links` _(user)_ : a list of URL's to websites, documentation, etc. pertaining to the Operator or application being managed, each with a `name` and `url`.
* `spec.selector` _(user)_ : selectors by which the Operator can pair resources in a cluster.
* `spec.icon` _(user)_ : a base64-encoded icon unique to the Operator, set in a `base64data` field with a `mediatype`.
* `spec.maturity`: the Operator's maturity, ex. `alpha`.
