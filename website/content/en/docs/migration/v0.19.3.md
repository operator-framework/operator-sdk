## Upgrade your project from version "2" to "3-alpha"

The SDK's default Go plugin no longer supports OLM-related project files nor writes a `plugins` PROJECT field for projects scaffolded previously with `operator-sdk init --project-version=2`, Please migrate to project version "3-alpha" for support of these features by adding the following to your `PROJECT` file:
```yaml
version: "3-alpha" # Updated from "2" 
layout: go.kubebuilder.io/v2 
plugins:
  go.sdk.operatorframework.io/v2-alpha: {}
```

_See [#3716](https://github.com/operator-framework/operator-sdk/pull/3716) for more details._
