## Upgrade your project from version "2" to "3-alpha"

The SDK's default Go plugin no longer supports OLM- or scorecard-related project files nor writes a `plugins` PROJECT field for projects scaffolded previously with `operator-sdk init --project-version=2`, Please migrate to project version "3-alpha" for support of these features by adding the following to your `PROJECT` file:
```yaml version: "3-alpha" # Updated from "2" projectName: <output of $(basename $(pwd))> layout: go.kubebuilder.io/v2 plugins:
  go.sdk.operatorframework.io/v2-alpha: {}
```

_See [#3697](https://github.com/operator-framework/operator-sdk/pull/3697) for more details._

## Add the samples scaffold marker to your `config/samples/kustomization.yaml`

Add the `+kubebuilder:scaffold:manifestskustomizesamples` to your `config/samples/kustomization.yaml` file like so (using an example sample file):
```yaml resources: - cache_v1alpha1_memcached.yaml # +kubebuilder:scaffold:manifestskustomizesamples ```

_See [#3645](https://github.com/operator-framework/operator-sdk/pull/3645) for more details._

## Update your Makefile's `bundle` recipe to inject an operator image tag.

Make the following update to your Makefile's `bundle` recipe, which will allow you to set `make bundle IMG=<tag>`:
```make bundle: ...
  operator-sdk generate kustomize manifests -q
  cd config/manager && $(KUSTOMIZE) edit set image controller=$(IMG) # Add this line
  ...
```

_See [#3634](https://github.com/operator-framework/operator-sdk/pull/3634) for more details._

## Update usage of `operator-sdk cleanup`

The `operator-sdk cleanup packagemanifests` command has been
removed and replaced with a simpler `operator-sdk cleanup`
command.

Update usages of `operator-sdk cleanup packagemanifests` to
use `operator-sdk cleanup <packageName>`.

The value for `<packageName>` can be found in the `*.package.yaml`
file in the root of your packagemanifests folder. It is typically
your project name.

_See [#3644](https://github.com/operator-framework/operator-sdk/pull/3644) for more details._

## Remove `olm-namespace` flag from `operator-sdk olm install` command

The `olm-namespace` flag has been removed from `operator-sdk olm install`
command, as the olm manifests published in github have a hardcoded
namespace value. Hence, the olm operators can only be installed in `olm`
namespace using this command.

_See [#3670](https://github.com/operator-framework/operator-sdk/pull/3670) for more details._

## Docker images for `s390x` are no longer created automatically

If you require an `s390x` image for a particular release, please open an issue in the operator-sdk GitHub project, and the maintainers will manually build and push an s390x image for supported versions

_See [#3710](https://github.com/operator-framework/operator-sdk/pull/3710) for more details._

## Default install mode for `run packagemanifests` changed from `OwnNamespace` to `AllNamespaces`

By default all operators are scaffolded to run at the cluster scope and watch all namespaces.
However, if you are relying on the default behavior of the `run packagemanifests` command to use the default `OwnNamespace` install mode, you must now specify it explicitly with `--install-mode=OwnNamespace`.

_See [#3663](https://github.com/operator-framework/operator-sdk/pull/3663) for more details._
