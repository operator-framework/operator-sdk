## update ansible operator Makefile's run target

For an ansible operator, update the Makefile's run target to the
following to fix a bug in its implementation.

```
.PHONY: run
ANSIBLE_ROLES_PATH?="$(shell pwd)/roles"
run: ansible-operator ## Run against the configured Kubernetes cluster in ~/.kube/config
    $(ANSIBLE_OPERATOR) run
```

_See [#6110](https://github.com/operator-framework/operator-sdk/pull/6110) for more details._
