## (ansible/v1) Bump Kustomize version in helm project scaffolding to 3.8.7

Ansible projects are now scaffolded with `Kustomize` version `3.8.7`. This version of kustomize requires that the path to patch file be provided with the `--path` flag in `add patch` command. In `molecule/default/prepare.yml` file, update the command under `Set pull policy`, to be:
```diff
     - name: Set pull policy
-      command: '{{ "{{ kustomize }}" }} edit add patch pull_policy/{{ "{{ operator_pull_policy }}" }}.yaml'
+      command: '{{ "{{ kustomize }}" }} edit add patch --path pull_policy/{{ "{{ operator_pull_policy }}" }}.yaml'
```
