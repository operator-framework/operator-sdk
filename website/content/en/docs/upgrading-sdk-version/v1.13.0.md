## (Optional) Update local version of `ansible-runner`

`ansible-runner` 2.0+ includes a backwards incompatible change in the command signature, so in order to use `make run` with Ansible-based operators, users will need to upgrade their local version of `ansible-runner` to 2.0.2+

_See [#5205](https://github.com/operator-framework/operator-sdk/pull/5205) for more details._
