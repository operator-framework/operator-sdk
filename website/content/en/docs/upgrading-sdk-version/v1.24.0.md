## Support for arm64

In Ansible & Helm-based operators, if you need to support `arm64`, add the following

  `| sed 's/aarch64/arm64/'` 

on the following line

  `ARCH := $(shell uname -m | sed 's/x86_64/amd64/')`

The resulting line should look like this

  `ARCH := $(shell uname -m | sed 's/x86_64/amd64/' | sed 's/aarch64/arm64/')`

_See [#5480](https://github.com/operator-framework/operator-sdk/pull/5480) for more details._
