## operator-sdk generate packagemanifests

Generates package manifests data for the operator

### Synopsis


Note: while the package manifests format is not yet deprecated, the operator-framework is migrated
towards using bundles by default. Run 'operator-sdk generate bundle -h' for more information.

This command generates a set of manifests in a versioned directory and a package manifest file for
your operator. Each versioned directory consists of a ClusterServiceVersion (CSV), CustomResourceDefinitions (CRDs),
and manifests not part of the CSV but required by the operator.

A CSV manifest is generated by collecting data from the set of manifests passed to this command (see below),
such as CRDs, RBAC, etc., and applying that data to a "base" CSV manifest. This base CSV can contain metadata,
added by hand or by the 'generate kustomize manifests' command, and can be passed in like any other manifest
(see below) or by file at the exact path '&lt;kustomize-dir&gt;/bases/&lt;package-name&gt;.clusterserviceversion.yaml'.
Be aware that 'generate packagemanifests' idempotently regenerates a packagemanifests directory,
so all non-metadata values in a base will be overwritten. If no base was passed in, input manifest data
will be applied to an empty CSV.

There are two ways to pass the to-be-packaged set of manifests to this command: stdin via a Unix pipe,
or in a directory using '--input-dir'. See command help for more information on these modes.
Passing a directory is useful for running 'generate packagemanifests' outside of a project or within a project
that does not use kustomize and/or contains cluster-ready manifests on disk.

Set '--version' to supply a semantic version for your new package.

```
operator-sdk generate packagemanifests [flags]
```

### Examples

```

  # If running within a project, make sure a 'config' kustomize directory exists and has a 'config/manifests':
  $ tree config/manifests
  config/manifests
  ├── bases
  │   └── memcached-operator.clusterserviceversion.yaml
  └── kustomization.yaml

  # Generate a 0.0.1 packagemanifests by passing manifests to stdin:
  $ kustomize build config/manifests | operator-sdk generate packagemanifests --version 0.0.1
  Generating package manifests version 0.0.1
  ...

  # If running outside of a project, make sure cluster-ready manifests are available on disk:
  $ tree deploy/
  deploy/
  ├── crds
  │   └── cache.my.domain_memcacheds.yaml
  ├── deployment.yaml
  ├── role.yaml
  ├── role_binding.yaml
  ├── service_account.yaml
  └── webhooks.yaml

  # Generate a 0.0.1 packagemanifests by passing manifests by dir:
  $ operator-sdk generate packagemanifests --deploy-dir deploy --version 0.0.1
  Generating package manifests version 0.0.1
  ...

  # After running in either of the above modes, you should see this directory structure:
  $ tree packagemanifests/
  packagemanifests/
  ├── 0.0.1
  │   ├── cache.my.domain_memcacheds.yaml
  │   └── memcached-operator.clusterserviceversion.yaml
  └── memcached-operator.package.yaml

```

### Options

```
      --channel string         Channel name for the generated package
      --crds-dir string        Directory to read cluster-ready CustomResoureDefinition manifests from. This option can only be used if --deploy-dir is set
      --default-channel        Use the channel passed to --channel as the package manifest file's default channel
      --deploy-dir string      Directory to read cluster-ready operator manifests from. If --crds-dir is not set, CRDs are ready from this directory
      --from-version string    Semantic version of the operator being upgraded from
  -h, --help                   help for packagemanifests
      --input-dir string       Directory to read existing package manifests from. This directory is the parent of individual versioned package directories, and different from --deploy-dir (default "packagemanifests")
      --kustomize-dir string   Directory containing kustomize bases in a "bases" dir and a kustomization.yaml for operator-framework manifests (default "config/manifests")
      --output-dir string      Directory in which to write package manifests
      --package string         Package name
  -q, --quiet                  Run in quiet mode
      --stdout                 Write package to stdout
      --update-objects         Update non-CSV objects in this package, ex. CustomResoureDefinitions, Roles (default true)
  -v, --version string         Semantic version of the packaged operator
```

### Options inherited from parent commands

```
      --plugins strings   plugin keys to be used for this subcommand execution
      --verbose           Enable verbose logging
```
